= Deploy {productname} on OpenShift with Quay Operator

{productname} is an enterprise-quality container registry. Use {productname} to build and
store container images, then make them available to deploy across your enterprise.

The Quay Operator provides a simple method to deploy and manage a {productname} cluster.
This is the preferred procedure for deploying {productname} on OpenShift and is covered in this guide.

Note that this version of the {productname} Operator has been completely rewritten and differs substantially from earlier versions.  Please review this documentation carefully.
