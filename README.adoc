= Contributing to Red Hat Quay documentation
:downstream:

== Repository structure

The Red Hat Quay repository is structured as follows:

* Books go into a top-level directory. For example, `repo_dir/manage_quay` or `repo_dir/release_notes`. 
* Each book directory has a symlink to the top-level `repo_dir/modules` directory. 
* A book's _table of contents_, or ToC, is defined in the `master.adoc` that is contained within the book's directory. Each directory has its own `master.adoc` file. 
* The `master.adoc` file contains `include` statements to _modules_, which act as chapters and subchapters. These are created in the top-level `modules/` directory. 
* The `docinfo.xml` in the book's directory contains basic information about the book, such as the product name, the product version, and the organization name. 

== Setting up your repository for contribution

ifdef::downstream[]

. For _downstream_ contribution, which is the official Red Hat Quay documentation found on the Red Hat portal, you must obtain _Developer_, _Maintainer_, or _Owner_ permissions for the https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/red-hat-quay-documentation/quay-documentation/[downstream repository].
+
To obtain the necessary permissions, contact a Maintainer or Owner from the Gitlab project members https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/red-hat-quay-documentation/quay-documentation/-/project_members[list]. Default to contacting Steven Smith.

endif::downstream[]

. Fork the  https://github.com/quay/quay-docs[upstream repository] by clicking the *Fork* button.

. Clone your fork of the repository to your computer:
+
----
$ git clone git@github.com:<username>/quay-docs.git
----
+
Substitute `<username>` with your GitHub user name.

. Navigate to the cloned repository:
+
----
$ cd quay-docs
----

. Add the `upstream` remote:
+
----
$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:quay/quay-docs.git
----

[id="how-do-i-make-a-contribution"]
== How do I make a contribution?

To contribute to Red Hat Quay documentation, you must create a new feature branch based off of the `master` branch.

. Checkout the `master` branch if you have not already:
+
----
$ git checkout master
----

. Create a new feature branch based off the `master` branch:
+
----
$ git checkout -b <branch_name> 3.0-master
----
+
Substitute `<branch_name>` with a name that reflects the contribution you intend to make.

. Edit the files and commit them using `git add` and `git commit`. Make your commit in present tense, highlighting the change that you have made.

. Push your commits to your fork of the upstream repository:
+
----
$ git push origin <branch_name>
----

. Create a pull request from `<your_fork>/<branch_name>` to `quay/master`. For that, either:
+
--
.. Visit the link from the output of the previous step. The link is there after the first push only.

.. Navigate to https://github.com/<your_username>/quay-docs. Use the interface to create the pull request
--
+
As you create the pull request, tag one of the repository collaborators and ask them to review the pull request. The default contact should be Steven Smith.

. Work with the reviewer to finish your pull request. After the suggested changes have been made, the reviewer will merge the pull request.

. After your pull request is merged into the `master` branch, your updates will become live in the https://docs.projectquay.io[Project Quay documentation]. Eventually, those changes will end up on the portal. 

== How do I make a contribution to the downstream documentation?

Like upstream documentation, downstream documentation primarily resides in the `master` branch of the https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/red-hat-quay-documentation/quay-documentation/[downstream repository]. For most users, the only necessary step is to create a feature branch from the `master` branch.

To make a contribution to upstream documentation, follow the instructions at <<how-do-i-make-a-contribution>>. Be sure to work with the documentation lead for Red Hat Quay to get the content reviewed, merged, and published on the downstream portal. 

=== How Red Hat Quay downstream documentation is branched

After you have created and merged a pull request, relevant branches are then reset to match the `master` branch. For example, if the current version of Red Hat Quay is 3.10, then the relevant 3.10 branch (`redhat-3.10`) is reset to match the `master`. branch. This ensures that the most recent content changes are up to date in the most recent version branch. 

After the the most recent branch is reset to match the `master` branch, the `3.0-stage` branch is then reset to match the most recent version branch (for example, `3.0-stage` is reset to match `redhat-3.10`). The reason for this is that the Red Hat Quay `3` version is copied directly from the most recent version of Red Hat Quay. 

[id="how-do-i-keep-my-local-master-up-to-date-with-remote-master"]
== How do I keep my local `master` up-to-date with remote `master`?

As contributors push and merge pull requests to the `master` branch, you must keep your local `master` branch up to date. Prior to making any changes to the documentation, you should rebase your local `master` branch to match the most recent version of the remote `master` branch. 

. Check out the `master` branch:
+
----
$ git checkout master
----

. Fetch the commits that are in the upstream repository but not in your local repository:
+
----
$ git fetch upstream
----

. Apply the fetched commits to your local `master`:
+
----
$ git rebase upstream/master
----

Now, your local `master` branch is up to date.

== How do I keep my feature branch up-to-date with the master branch?

As new commits appear on the `master` branch, your existing feature branch does not automatically incorporate those commits. To prevent your feature branch and `master` from diverging, you need to manually update your feature branch to the `master` branch:

. Bring your local `master` brnach up-to-date with the remote `master` branch by following the instructions at <<how-do-i-keep-my-local-master-up-to-date-with-remote-master>>.

. Switch to the feature branch that you want to update:
+
----
$ git checkout <feature_branch>
----

. Apply the commits from the `master` branch to your `<feature_branch>`:
+
----
$ git rebase upstream/master
----
+

. Push the updated `<feature_branch>` to your fork of the upstream repository. Since your local `<feature_branch>` has been updated, it might be incompatible with the remote `<feature_branch>`, so you need to use the `--force` option:
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Never use the `--force` argument when pushing to `master`.
====
+
----
$ git push --force origin <feature_branch>
----

== How do I keep the downstream repository and branch up-to-date?

To bring the https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/red-hat-quay-documentation/quay-documentation/[downstream repository] up-to-date with the upstream repository, you need to push the changes to the `3.0-master` branch of the downstream repository and merge `3.0-master` into `3.0-stage`, from which downstream documentation is published:

. Update your local `3.0-master` branch. <<how-do-i-keep-my-local-3.0-master-up-to-date-with-remote-3.0-master>>

. Switch to the `3.0-master` branch:
+
----
$ git checkout 3.0-master
----

. Push `3.0-master` to the downstream repository:
+
----
$ git push downstream
----

. Switch to the `3.0-stage` branch:
+
----
$ git checkout 3.0-stage
----

. Merge `3.0-master` into `3.0-stage`:
+
----
$ git merge 3.0-master
----

. Push `3.0-stage` to the downstream repository:
+
----
$ git push downstream

== How do I make content appear in upstream but not in downstream?

You can make content appear only in the upstream by using the `ifdef::upstream` conditional around the content that you only want to appear upstream. For example: 

----
\ifdef::upstream[]
<Content that should be in upstream only.>
\endif::upstream[]
----

ifdef::downstream[]
== How do I make content appear in downstream but not in upstream?

You can make content appear only in the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/[downstream] by using the `ifdef::downstream` conditional around the content that you only want to appear downstream. For example: 

----
\ifdef::downstream[]
<Content that should be in downstream only.>
\endif::downstream[]
----
endif::downstream[]
