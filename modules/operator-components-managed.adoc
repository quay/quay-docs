[role="_abstract"]
Managed components are {productname} registry components that the Operator automatically configures and installs. By using managed components, you simplify deployment and reduce manual configuration tasks. 

.QuayRegistry required fields
[cols="2a,1a,2a",options="header"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description

|`quay` |Boolean | Holds overrides for deployment of {productname-ocp}, such as environment variables and number of replicas. This component cannot be set to unmanaged (`managed: false`).
|`postgres` |Boolean | Used for storing registry metadata. Currently, PostgreSQL version 13 is used.
|`clair` |Boolean | Provides image vulnerability scanning. 
|`redis` |Boolean | Storage live builder logs and the locking mechanism that is required for garbage collection.
|`horizontalpodautoscaler` |Boolean | Adjusts the number of `quay` pods depending on your memory and CPU consumption.
|`objectstorage` |Boolean | Stores image layer blobs. When set to `managed: true`, utilizes the `ObjectBucketClaim` Kubernetes API which is provided by NooBaa or {odf}. Setting this field to `managed: false` requires you to provide your own object storage.
|`route` |Boolean | Provides an external entrypoint to the {productname} registry from outside of {ocp}.
|`mirror` |Boolean | Configures repository mirror workers to support optional repository mirroring.
|`monitoring` |Boolean | Features include a Grafana dashboard, access to individual metrics, and notifications for frequently restarting `quay` pods.
|`tls` |Boolean | Configures whether SSL/TLS is automatically handled.
|`clairpostgres` |Boolean | Configures a managed Clair database. This is a separate database than the PostgreSQL database that is used to deploy {productname}.

The following example shows you the default configuration for the `QuayRegistry` custom resource provided by the {productname} Operator. It is available on the {ocp} web console.
