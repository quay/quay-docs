== {productname} 3.16.1 bug fixes

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-6767[*PROJQUAY-6767*]. Before this update, the v2 UI could not download build logs after an image was built successfully on the UI. This error has been resolved, and you can now download build logs by clicking the *Download* button on the *Builds* page.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-10083[*PROJQUAY-10083*]. Before this update, an error in the container build process prevents the Prometheus Pushgateway from starting correctly. Instead of the executable binary, the entire source directory was incorrectly copied to `/usr/local/bin/pushgateway`. This causes the service to fail on startup, resulting in `Connection refused` errors (`Errno 111`) in the logs when workers attempt to push metrics.

This error has been resolved and Prometheus metrics are now available with {productname} 3.16.1.
