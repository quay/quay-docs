=== {productname} 3.13.6 bug fixes

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-8817[PROJQUAY-8817]. With this release, the {productname} Operator supports the customization of the `haproxy.router.openshift.io/timeout` annotation when the route component is set to managed (managed: true). For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
kind: Route
metadata:
  annotations:
    haproxy.router.openshift.io/timeout: 30m
# ...
----
+
In this example, the timeout value is set to 30 minutes, which allows pushing large image layers.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-8821[PROJQUAY-8821]. With this release, the {productname} Operator now garbage collects unneeded secrets.
