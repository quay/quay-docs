[id="upgrading-helm-38"]
== Upgrading to Helm 3.8

[id="enabling-system-trust-ssl-tls-certs"]
== Enabling your system to trust SSL/TLS certificates used by {productname}

Communication between the Helm client and {productname} is facilitated over HTTPS. As of Helm 3.5, support is only available for registries communicating over HTTPS with trusted certificates. In addition, the operating system must trust the certificates exposed by the registry. You must ensure that your operating system has been configured to trust the certificates used by {productname}. Use the following procedure to enable your system to trust the custom certificates.

.Procedure

. Enter the following command to copy the `rootCA.pem` file to the `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/` folder:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo cp rootCA.pem   /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
----

. Enter the following command to update the CA trust store:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo update-ca-trust extract
