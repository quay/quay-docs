= Helm and OCI prerequisites

* **Trusted certificates:** Communication between the Helm client and Quay is facilitated over HTTPS and as of Helm 3.5, support is only available for registries communicating over HTTPS with trusted certificates. In addition, the operating system must trust the certificates exposed by the registry. Support in future Helm releases will allow for communicating with remote registries insecurely. With that in mind, ensure that your operating system has been configured to trust the certificates used by Quay, for example:
+
----
$ sudo cp rootCA.pem   /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
$ sudo update-ca-trust extract
----

* **Generally available:** As of Helm 3.8, OCI registry support for charts is now generally available.

* **Install Helm client:** Download your desired version from the link:https://github.com/helm/helm/releases[Helm releases] page. Unpack it and move the helm binary to its desired destination:
+
----
$ tar -zxvf helm-v3.8.2-linux-amd64.tar.gz
$ mv linux-amd64/helm /usr/local/bin/helm
----

* **Create organization in Quay:** Create a new organization for storing the Helm charts, using the Quay registry UI. For example, create an organization named `helm`.
