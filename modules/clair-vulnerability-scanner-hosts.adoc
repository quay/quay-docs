== Information about Open Source Vulnerability (OSV) database for Clair

Open Source Vulnerability (OSV) is a vulnerability database and monitoring service that focuses on tracking and managing security vulnerabilities in open source software. 

OSV provides a comprehensive and up-to-date database of known security vulnerabilities in open source projects. It covers a wide range of open source software, including libraries, frameworks, and other components that are used in software development. For a full list of included ecosystems, see link:https://ossf.github.io/osv-schema/#affectedpackage-field[defined ecosystems]. 

Clair also reports vulnerability and security information for `golang`, `java`, and `ruby` ecosystems through the Open Source Vulnerability (OSV) database.

By leveraging OSV, developers and organizations can proactively monitor and address security vulnerabilities in open source components that they use, which helps to reduce the risk of security breaches and data compromises in projects. 

For more information about OSV, see link:https://osv.dev/[the OSV website].
