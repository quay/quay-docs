== Set up Redis
With Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 server installed on each of the three {productname}
systems (quay01, quay02, and quay03), install and start the Redis service as follows:

//. **Setup Docker**: Install, enable, and start the docker service as shown here (see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux_atomic_host/7/html-single/getting_started_with_containers/index#getting_docker_in_rhel_7[Getting Docker in RHEL 7] for details):

. **Install / Deploy link:https://access.redhat.com/containers/?tab=overview#/registry.access.redhat.com/rhel8/redis-5)[Redis]**: Run Redis as a container on each of the three quay0* systems:

+
....
# mkdir -p /var/lib/redis
# chmod 777 /var/lib/redis
# sudo podman run -d -p 6379:6379 \
    -v /var/lib/redis:/var/lib/redis/data:Z \
    registry.redhat.io/rhel8/redis-5
....

. **Check redis connectivity**: You can use the `telnet` command to test connectivity to the redis service. Type MONITOR (to begin monitoring the service) and QUIT to exit:
+
....
# yum install telnet -y
# telnet 192.168.122.99 6379
Trying 192.168.122.99...
