== {productname} 3.14.4 bug fixes

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-9136[PROJQUAY-9136]. Before this update, Alembic migrations failed to install certificates during run, causing issues with {productname} behind HTTPS proxy due to lack of certificates. As a consequence, users experienced migration failure when {productname} was behind an HTTPS proxy. With this release, Alembic migrations no longer require manual certificate installation for {productname} behind HTTPS proxy. As a result, Alembic migrations can now install certs, allowing smooth operation behind HTTPS proxies.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-9156[PROJQUAY-9156]. Previously, some `read-only` permissions were missing for `read-only` superusers. This issue has been resolved.
