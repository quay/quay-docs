= Mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift

The _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ is small-scale version of {productname} that you can use as a target for mirroring the required container images of {ocp} for disconnected installations.

For disconnected deployments of {ocp}, a container registry is required to carry out the installation of the clusters. To run a production-grade registry service on such a cluster, you must create a separate registry deployment to install the first cluster. The _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ addresses this need and is included in every {ocp} subscription. It is available for download on the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads#tool-mirror-registry[OpenShift console *Downloads*] page.

The _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ allows users to install a small-scale version of {productname} and its required components using the `mirror-registry` command line interface (CLI) tool. The _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ is deployed automatically with pre-configured local storage and a local database. It also includes auto-generated user credentials and access permissions with a single set of inputs and no additional configuration choices to get started.

The _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ provides a pre-determined network configuration and reports deployed component credentials and access URLs upon success. A limited set of optional configuration inputs like fully qualified domain name (FQDN) services, superuser name and password, and custom TLS certificates are also provided. This provides users with a container registry so that they can easily create an offline mirror of all {ocp} release content when running {ocp} in restricted network environments.

The _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ is limited to hosting images that are required to install a disconnected {ocp} cluster, such as release images or Operator images. It uses local storage. Content built by customers should not be hosted by the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_.

Unlike {productname}, the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ is not a highly-available registry. Only local file system storage is supported. Using the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ with more than one cluster is discouraged, because multiple clusters can create a single point of failure when updating your cluster fleet. It is advised to use the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ to install a cluster that can host a production-grade, highly available registry such as {productname}, which can serve {ocp} content to other clusters.
