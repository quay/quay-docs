== {productname} 3.14.1 bug fixes

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-8673[PROJQUAY-8673], link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-8680[PROJQUAY-8680], link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-8740[PROJQUAY-8740]. Previously, the v2 UI model card feature did not render tables correctly; additionally, the UI did not display the checkbox in the correct format. With this release, issues with rendering have been resolved.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-8716[PROJQUAY-8716]. Previously, the *Model Card* tab displayed as *ModelCard* on the v2 UI. Now, it correctly displays as *Model Card*.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-8771[PROJQUAY-8771]. With this release, the {productname} Operator supports the customization of the `haproxy.router.openshift.io/timeout` annotation when the `route` component is set to managed (`managed: true`). For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
kind: Route
metadata:
  annotations:
    haproxy.router.openshift.io/timeout: 30m
# ...
----
+
In this example, the timeout value is set to 30 minutes, which allows pushing large image layers.
