= Permissions

Organizations are organized into a set of Teams and can provide access to a subset of the repositories under that namespace. Permissions for users within an organization can be set for individuals, teams, and robot accounts.

[NOTE]
====
Permissions are only applied to new users and teams when a new repository is created.
