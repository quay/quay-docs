[id="upgrading-postgresql"]
= Updating {productname} and the {productname} and Clair PostgreSQL databases on {ocp}

When updating {productname} 3.8 -> 3.9, the Operator automatically upgrades the existing PostgreSQL databases for Clair and {productname} from version 10 to version 13. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Users with a managed database are required to upgrade their PostgreSQL database from 10 -> 13.
* If your {productname} and Clair databases are managed by the Operator, the database upgrades for each component must succeed for the 3.9.0 upgrade to be successful. If either of the database upgrades fail, the entire {productname} version upgrade fails. This behavior is expected. 
====

You can update {productname} and the {productname} and Clair PostgreSQL databases on {ocp} by using the *Web Console* UI, or by using the CLI.

==  Updating {productname} and the {productname} and Clair PostgreSQL databases using the {ocp} web console

Use the following procedure to update {productname} and the {productname} and Clair PostgreSQL databases using the {ocp} web console. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
* This upgrade is irreversible. It is highly recommended that you upgrade to PostgreSQL 13. PostgreSQL 10 had its final release on November 10, 2022 and is no longer supported. For more information, see the link:https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/[PostgreSQL Versioning Policy]. 
* * If your {productname} and Clair databases are managed by the Operator, the database upgrades for each component must succeed for the 3.9.0 upgrade to be successful. If either of the database upgrades fail, the entire {productname} version upgrade fails. This behavior is expected. 
* By default, {productname} is configured to remove old persistent volume claims (PVCs) from PostgreSQL 10. To disable this setting and backup old PVCs, you must set `POSTGRES_UPGRADE_RETAIN_BACKUP` to `True` in your `config.yaml` file. 
====

.Prerequisites 

* You have installed {productname} 3.6, 3.7, or 3.8 on {ocp}. 
* 100 GB of free, additional storage.
+
During the upgrade process, additional persistent volume claims (PVCs) are provisioned to store the migrated data. This helps prevent a destructive operation on user data. The upgrade process rolls out PVCs for 50 GB for both the {productname} database upgrade, and the Clair database upgrade. 

.Procedure

. Optional. Back up your old PVCs from PostgreSQL 10 by setting `POSTGRES_UPGRADE_RETAIN_BACKUP` to `True` your `quay-operator` `Subscription` object. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: quay-operator
  namespace: quay-enterprise
spec:
  channel: stable-3.8
  name: quay-operator
  source: redhat-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
  config:
    env: 
    - name: POSTGRES_UPGRADE_RETAIN_BACKUP
      value: "true"
----

. In the {ocp} Web Console, navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*. 

. Click on the {productname} Operator. 

. Navigate to the *Subscription* tab. 

. Under *Subscription details* click *Update channel*. 

. Select *stable-3.9* and save the changes. 

. Check the progress of the new installation under *Upgrade status*. Wait until the upgrade status changes to *1 installed* before proceeding. 

. In your {ocp} cluster, navigate to *Workloads* -> *Pods*. Existing pods should be terminated, or in the process of being terminated. 

. Wait for the following pods, which are responsible for upgrading the database and alembic migration of existing data, to spin up: `clair-postgres-upgrade`, `quay-postgres-upgrade`, and `quay-app-upgrade`. 

. After the `clair-postgres-upgrade`, `quay-postgres-upgrade`, and `quay-app-upgrade` pods are marked as *Completed*, the remaining pods for your {productname} deployment spin up. This takes approximately ten minutes. 

. Verify that the `quay-database` and `clair-postgres` pods now use the `postgresql-13` image. 

. After the `quay-app` pod is marked as *Running*, you can reach your {productname} registry.

==  Updating {productname} and the {productname} and Clair PostgreSQL databases using the CLI

Use the following procedure to update {productname} and the {productname} and Clair PostgreSQL databases using the command-line interface (CLI). 

[IMPORTANT]

* This upgrade is irreversible. It is highly recommended that you upgrade to PostgreSQL 13. PostgreSQL 10 had its final release on November 10, 2022 and is no longer supported. For more information, see the link:https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/[PostgreSQL Versioning Policy].

.Procedure

. Retrieve your `quay-operator` configuration file by entering the following `oc get` command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get subscription quay-operator -n quay-enterprise -o yaml > quay-operator.yaml
----

. Retrieve the latest version of the {productname} Operator and its channel by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
oc get packagemanifests quay-operator \
  -o jsonpath='{range .status.channels[*]}{@.currentCSV} {@.name}{"\n"}{end}' \
  | awk '{print "STARTING_CSV=" $1 " CHANNEL=" $2 }' \
  | sort -nr \
  | head -1
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
STARTING_CSV=quay-operator.v3.9.0 CHANNEL=stable-3.9
----

. Using the output from the previous command, update your `Subscription` custom resource for the {productname} Operator and save it as `quay-operator.yaml`. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: quay-operator
  namespace: quay-enterprise
spec:
  channel: stable-3.9 <1>
  name: quay-operator
  source: redhat-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
  config:
    env: 
    - name: POSTGRES_UPGRADE_RETAIN_BACKUP <2>
      value: "true"
----
<1> Specify the value you obtained in the previous step for the `spec.channel` parameter. 
<2> Optional. Back up your old PVCs from PostgreSQL 10 by setting `POSTGRES_UPGRADE_RETAIN_BACKUP` to `True` your `quay-operator` `Subscription` object.

. Enter the following command to apply the configuration:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f quay-operator.yaml
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
subscription.operators.coreos.com/quay-operator created
