= Creating the QuayIntegration custom resource

Create a `QuayIntegration` custom resource (CR) to connect an {ocp} cluster to a {productname} registry. The `QuayIntegration` CR defines the {productname} hostname, authentication details, and configuration options that the {qbo} uses to synchronize {ocp} projects with {productname} organizations, robot accounts, and other features.

The `QuayIntegration` custom resource can be created by using the {ocp} web console, or from the command-line interface.
