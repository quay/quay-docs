= Creating the QuayIntegration custom resource

[role="_abstract"]
The `QuayIntegration` custom resource connects your {ocp} cluster to a {productname} registry and defines the configuration that the {qbo} uses to synchronize projects, organizations, and robot accounts.

The `QuayIntegration` custom resource can be created by using the {ocp} web console, or from the command-line interface.
