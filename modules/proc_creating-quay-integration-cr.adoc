== Creating the QuayIntegration custom resource

In this procedure, you will create a `QuayIntegration` custom resource, which can be completed from either the web console or from the command line.

.Prerequisites

* You have set up {productname} and obtained an access token.
* You have deployed the {qbo} on {ocp}.
* An {ocp} 4.6 or greater environment for which you have cluster administrator permissions.
* Optional: You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

=== Optional: Creating the QuayIntegration custom resource using the CLI

Follow this procedure to create the `QuayIntegration` custom resource using the command line.

.Procedure

. Create a `quay-integration.yaml`:
+
----
$ touch quay-integration.yaml
----

. Use the following configuration for a minimal deployment of the `QuayIntegration` custom resource:
+
[source,yaml]
----
  apiVersion: quay.redhat.com/v1
  kind: QuayIntegration
  metadata:
    name: example-quayintegration
  spec:
    clusterID: openshift  <1>
    credentialsSecret:
      namespace: openshift-operators
      name: quay-integration<2>
    quayHostname: https://<QUAY_URL>   <3>
    insecureRegistry: false <4>
----
<1> The clusterID value should be unique across the entire ecosystem. This value is required and defaults to `openshift`.
<2> The `credentialsSecret` property refers to the namespace and name of the secret containing the token that was previously created.
<3> Replace the `QUAY_URL` with the hostname of your {productname} instance.
<4> If {productname} is using self signed certificates, set the property to `insecureRegistry: true`.
+
For a list of all configuration fields, see "QuayIntegration configuration fields".

. Create the `QuayIntegration` custom resource:
+
----
$ oc create -f quay-integration.yaml
----

=== Optional: Creating the QuayIntegration custom resource using the web console

Follow this procedure to create the `QuayIntegration` custom resource using the web console.

.Procedure

. Open the *Administrator* perspective of the web console and navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.

. Click *Red Hat {qbo}*.

. On the *Details* page of the {qbo}, click *Create Instance* on the *Quay Integration* API card.

. On the *Create QuayIntegration* page, enter the following required information in either *Form view* or *YAML view*:
+
* *Name*: The name that will refer to the `QuayIntegration` custom resource object.
* *Cluster ID*: The ID associated with this cluster. This value should be unique across the entire ecosystem. Defaults to `openshift` if left unspecified.
* *Credentials secret*: Refers to the namespace and name of the secret containing the token that was previously created.
* *Quay hostname*: The hostname of the Quay registry.
+
For a list of all configuration fields, see "QuayIntegration configuration fields".

After the `QuayIntegration` custom resource is created, your {ocp} cluster will be linked to your {productname} instance. Organizations within your {productname} registry should be created for the related namespace for the {ocp} environment.
