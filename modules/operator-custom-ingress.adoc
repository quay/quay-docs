= Configuring custom ingress

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure custom ingress for {productname} by disabling the Operator-managed `route` component and managing your own routes or ingress controllers. This configuration is useful when your environment requires a custom SSL/TLS setup, specific DNS naming conventions, or when {productname} is deployed behind a load balancer or proxy that handles TLS termination.

The {productname} Operator separates route management from SSL/TLS configuration by introducing a distinct `tls` component. You can therefore manage each independently, depending on whether {productname} or the cluster should handle TLS termination. For more information about using SSL/TLS certificates with your deployment, see "Securing {productname}".

[NOTE]
====
If you disable the managed `route`, you are responsible for creating and managing a `Route`, `Ingress`, or `Service` to expose {productname}. Ensure that your DNS entry matches the `SERVER_HOSTNAME` configured in `config.yaml`.
