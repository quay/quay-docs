= Logging and debugging variables

The following variables control how {productname} logs events, exposes debugging information, and interacts with system health checks. These settings are useful for troubleshooting and monitoring your registry

.Logging and debug configuration variables
[cols="3a,1a,2a",options="header"]
|===
| Variable | Type | Description
| **DEBUGLOG** | Boolean | Whether to enable or disable debug logs. 
| **USERS_DEBUG** |Integer. Either `0` or `1`. | Used to debug LDAP operations in clear text, including passwords. Must be used with `DEBUGLOG=TRUE`. +
[IMPORTANT]
====
Setting `USERS_DEBUG=1` exposes credentials in clear text. This variable should be removed from the {productname} deployment after debugging. The log file that is generated with this environment variable should be scrutinized, and passwords should be removed before sending to other users. Use with caution.  
====

| **ALLOW_PULLS_WITHOUT_STRICT_LOGGING** | Boolean | If true, pulls will still succeed even if the pull audit log entry cannot be written . This is useful if the database is in a read-only state and it is desired for pulls to continue during that time. +
 +
 **Default:**  False

| **ENABLE_HEALTH_DEBUG_SECRET** | String |  If specified, a secret that can be given to health endpoints to see full debug info when not authenticated as a superuser

| **HEALTH_CHECKER** | String | The configured health check +
 +
**Example:** `('RDSAwareHealthCheck', {'access_key': 'foo', 'secret_key': 'bar'})`

| **FEATURE_AGGREGATED_LOG_COUNT_RETRIEVAL**  | Boolean |  Whether to allow retrieval of aggregated log counts + 
 + 
 **Default:** True
