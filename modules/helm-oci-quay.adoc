= Using Helm charts with Quay

Helm, as a graduated project of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), has become the de facto package manager for Kubernetes as it simplifies how applications are packaged and deployed. Helm uses a packaging format called Charts which contain the Kubernetes resources representing an application. Charts can be made available for general distribution and consumption in repositories. A Helm repository is an HTTP server that serves an index.yaml metadata file and optionally a set of packaged charts. Beginning with Helm version 3, support was made available for distributing charts in OCI registries as an alternative to a traditional repository. To demonstrate how Quay can be used as a registry for Helm charts, an existing chart from a Helm repository will be used to showcase the interaction with OCI registries for chart developers and users.


In the following example, a sample etherpad chart is downloaded from from the Red Community of Practice (CoP) repository and pushed to a local {productname} repository using the following steps:

* Add the appropriate repository
* Update the repository with the latest metadata
* Download and untar the chart to create a local directory called `etherpad`

For example:

----
$ helm repo add redhat-cop https://redhat-cop.github.io/helm-charts
$ helm repo update
$ helm pull redhat-cop/etherpad --version=0.0.4 --untar
----

Tagging the chart requires use of the `helm chart save` command - this corresponds to using `podman tag` for tagging images.

----
$ helm chart save ./etherpad example-registry-quay-quay-enterprise.apps.user1.example.com/helm/etherpad:0.0.4

ref:     example-registry-quay-quay-enterprise.apps.user1.example.com/helm/etherpad:0.0.4

size:    3.5 KiB
name:    etherpad
version: 0.0.4
0.0.4: saved
----


Use the `helm chart list` command to see the local instance of the chart:

----
helm chart list

REF                                                                               NAME     VERSION DIGEST SIZE   CREATED  
example-registry-quay-quay-enterprise.apps.user1.example.com/helm/etherpad:0.0.4 etherpad 0.0.4   ce0233f 3.5 KiB 23 seconds
----


Before pushing the chart, log in to the repository using the `helm registry login` command:

----
$ helm registry login example-registry-quay-quay-enterprise.apps.user1.example.com
Username: quayadmin
Password:
Login succeeded
----


Push the chart to your local Quay repository using the `helm chart push` command:

----
$ helm chart push example-registry-quay-quay-enterprise.apps.user1.example.com/helm/etherpad:0.0.4

The push refers to repository [example-registry-quay-quay-enterprise.apps.user1.example.com/helm/etherpad]
ref:     example-registry-quay-quay-enterprise.apps.user1.example.com/helm/etherpad:0.0.4
digest:  ce0233fd014992b8e27cc648cdabbebd4dd6850aca8fb8e50f7eef6f2f49833d
size:    3.5 KiB
name:    etherpad
version: 0.0.4
0.0.4: pushed to remote (1 layer, 3.5 KiB total)
----

To test that the push worked, delete the local copy and then pull the chart from the repository:

----
$ helm chart rm example-registry-quay-quay-enterprise.apps.user1.example.com/helm/etherpad:0.0.4
$ rm -rf etherpad
$ helm chart pull example-registry-quay-quay-enterprise.apps.user1.example.com/helm/etherpad:0.0.4

0.0.4: Pulling from example-registry-quay-quay-enterprise.apps.user1.example.com/helm/etherpad

----

Use the `helm chart export` command to extract the chart files:


----
$ helm chart export example-registry-quay-quay-enterprise.apps.user1.example.com/helm/etherpad:0.0.4
