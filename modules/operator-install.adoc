= Installing the {productname} Operator from the OperatorHub

To install the {productname} Operator from the {ocp} OperatorHub, configure the installation mode and update approval strategy. You should install the Operator cluster-wide to ensure the monitoring component is available; deploying to a specific namespace renders monitoring unavailable.

.Procedure

. On the {ocp} web console, click *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.

. In the search box, type *{productname}* and select the official {productname} Operator provided by Red{nbsp}Hat.

. Select *Install*.

. Select the update channel, for example, *stable-{producty}* and the version.

. For the *Installation* mode, select one of the following:
+
* **All namespaces on the cluster**. Select this option if you want the {productname} Operator to be available cluster-wide. It is recommended that you install the {productname} Operator cluster-wide. If you choose a single namespace, the monitoring component is not available.
+
* **A specific namespace on the cluster**. Select this option if you want {productname} deployed within a single namespace. Note that selecting this option renders the `monitoring` component unavailable.

. Select an *Approval Strategy*. Choose to approve either automatic or manual updates. Automatic update strategy is recommended.

. Select *Install*.
