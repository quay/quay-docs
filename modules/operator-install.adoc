. The following choices are available for customizing the installation:

* **Update Channel:** Choose the update channel, for example, `stable-3.7` for the latest release.

* **Installation Mode:** Choose  `All namespaces on the cluster` if you want the Operator to be available cluster-wide. Choose `A specific namespace on the cluster` if you want it deployed only within a single namespace. It is recommended that you install the Operator cluster-wide. If you choose a single namespace, the monitoring component will not be available by default.

* **Approval Strategy:** Choose to approve either automatic or manual updates. Automatic update strategy is recommended.

. Select Install.

. After a short time, you will see the Operator installed successfully in the Installed Operators page.
