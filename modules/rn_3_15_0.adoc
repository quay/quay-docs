[id="known-issues-and-limitations-315"]
== {productname} {producty} known issues and limitations

The following sections note known issues and limitations for {productname} 3.15.

[id="limitation-one"]
=== Limitation

When pushing an unsupported image type, for example, an AI model, to a {productname} registry, the *Security Report* and *Packages* pages on the UI fail to load. This occurs because these image types are stuck in a `Querying` status and, as a result, the pages of these tabs are left blank. This is a known issue and will be fixed in a future version of {productname}.

[id="limitation-two"]
=== Limitation 2

When pushing an unsupported image type, for example, an AI model, to a {productname} registry, the *Security Report* and *Packages* pages on the UI fail to load. This occurs because these image types are stuck in a `Querying` status and, as a result, the pages of these tabs are left blank. This is a known issue and will be fixed in a future version of {productname}.
