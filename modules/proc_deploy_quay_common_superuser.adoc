= Quay superuser

A `superuser` is a Quay user account that has extended privileges, including the ability to:

* Manage users
* Manage organizations
* Manage service keys
* View the change log
* Query the usage logs
* Create globally visible user messages

== Adding a superuser to Quay using the UI

Stop the Quay registry if it is running, and restart the container in configuration mode, loading the existing configuration as a volume:

[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
....
$ sudo podman run --rm -it --name quay_config \ 
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v $QUAY/config:/conf/stack:Z \
  {productrepo}/{quayimage}:{productminv} config secret
....


In the Access Settings section of the UI, enter the name of the user (in this instance, `quayadmin`) in the Super Users field and press Add.

Validate and download the configuration bundle and then terminate the Quay container that is running in config mode. Extract the `config.yaml` file to the configuration directory and restart the Quay container in registry mode. 

== Editing the config.yaml file to add a superuser

You can also add a superuser by editing the `config.yaml` file directly. The list of superuser accounts is stored as an array in the field `SUPER_USERS`:


.$QUAY/config/config.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
SERVER_HOSTNAME: quay-server:8080
SETUP_COMPLETE: true
SUPER_USERS:
  - quayadmin
...
----

== Accessing the superuser admin panel

To access the Super User Admin Panel, click on the current user's name or avatar in the top right-hand corner of the UI. If the user has been added as a superuser, an extra item is presented in the drop-down list called Super User Admin Panel.
