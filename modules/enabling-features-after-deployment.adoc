= Enabling features after deployment

[role="_abstract"]
After deployment, you can customize to the {productname} registry to enable new features and better suit the needs of your organization. This entails editing the {productname} configuration bundle secret (`spec.configBundleSecret`) resource. You can use the {ocp} web console or the command-line interface to enable features after deployment. Using the {ocp} web console is generally considered a simpler method.
