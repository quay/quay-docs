= Advanced {productname} configuration

You can configure your {productname} after initial deployment using one of the following methods:

////
* *Using the {productname} Config Tool*. With this tool, a web-based interface for configuring the {productname} cluster is provided when running the `Quay` container in `config` mode. This method is recommended for configuring the {productname} service.
////

* *Editing the `config.yaml` file*. The `config.yaml` file contains most configuration information for the {productname} cluster. Editing the `config.yaml` file directly is the primary method for advanced tuning and enabling specific features.

* *Using the {productname} API*. Some {productname} features can be configured through the API.

This content in this section describes how to use each of the aforementioned interfaces and how to configure your deployment with advanced features.

[id="using-the-config-tool"]
== Using {productname} Config Tool to modify {productname}

The {productname} Config Tool is made available by running a `Quay` container in `config` mode alongside the regular {productname} service.

Use the following sections to run the Config Tool from the {productname} Operator, or to run the Config Tool on host systems from the command line interface (CLI).

[id="running-config-tool-from-quay-operator"]
=== Running the Config Tool from the {productname} Operator

When running the {productname} Operator on {ocp}, the Config Tool is readily available to use. Use the following procedure to access the {productname} Config Tool.

.Prerequisites

. You have deployed the {productname} Operator on {ocp}.

.Procedure.

. On the OpenShift console, select the {productname} project, for example, `quay-enterprise`.

. In the navigation pane, select *Networking* -> *Routes*. You should see routes to both the {productname} application and Config Tool, as shown in the following image:
+
image:configtoolroute.png[View the route to the {productname} Config Tool]

. Select the route to the Config Tool, for example, `example-quayecosystem-quay-config`. The Config Tool UI should open in your browser.

. Select *Modify configuration for this cluster* to bring up the Config Tool setup, for example:
+
image:configtoolsetup.png[Modify {productname} cluster settings from the Config Tool]

. Make the desired changes, and then select *Save Configuration Changes*.

. Make any corrections needed by clicking *Continue Editing*, or, select *Next* to continue.

. When prompted, select *Download Configuration*. This will download a tarball of your new `config.yaml`, as well as any certificates and keys used with your {productname} setup. The `config.yaml` can be used to make advanced changes to your configuration or use as a future reference.

. Select *Go to deployment rollout* -> *Populate the configuration to deployments*. Wait for the {productname} pods to restart for the changes to take effect.


[id="running-config-tool-from-cli"]
=== Running the Config Tool from the command line

If you are running {productname} from a host system, you can use the following procedure to make changes to your configuration after the initial deployment.

. Prerequisites

* You have installed either `podman` or `docker`.

. Start {productname} in configuration mode.

. On the first `Quay` node, enter the following command:
+
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
$ podman run --rm -it --name quay_config -p 8080:8080 \
    -v path/to/config-bundle:/conf/stack \
    {productrepo}/{quayimage}:{productminv} config <my_secret_password>
----
+
[NOTE]
====
To modify an existing config bundle, you can mount your configuration directory into the `Quay` container.
====

. When the {productname} configuration tool starts, open your browser and navigate to the URL and port used in your configuration file, for example, `quay-server.example.com:8080`.

. Enter your username and password.

. Modify your {productname} cluster as desired.

[id="deploying-config-tool-using-tls"]
=== Deploying the config tool using TLS certificates

You can deploy the config tool with secured SSL/TLS certificates by passing environment variables to the runtime variable. This ensures that sensitive data like credentials for the database and storage backend are protected.

The public and private keys must contain valid Subject Alternative Names (SANs) for the route that you deploy the config tool on.

The paths can be specified using `CONFIG_TOOL_PRIVATE_KEY` and `CONFIG_TOOL_PUBLIC_KEY`.

If you are running your deployment from a container, the `CONFIG_TOOL_PRIVATE_KEY` and `CONFIG_TOOL_PUBLIC_KEY` values the locations of the certificates inside of the container. For example:

[source,terminal]
----
$ podman run --rm -it --name quay_config -p 7070:8080 \

-v ${PRIVATE_KEY_PATH}:/tls/localhost.key \
-v ${PUBLIC_KEY_PATH}:/tls/localhost.crt \
-e CONFIG_TOOL_PRIVATE_KEY=/tls/localhost.key \
-e CONFIG_TOOL_PUBLIC_KEY=/tls/localhost.crt \
-e DEBUGLOG=true \
-ti config-app:dev

[id="overview-advanced-config"]
== Using the API to modify {productname}

See the
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/red_hat_quay_api_reference/index[{productname} API Guide] for information on how to access {productname} API.

[id="editing-config-file-to-modify-quay"]
== Editing the config.yaml file to modify {productname}

Advanced features can be implemented by editing the `config.yaml` file directly. All configuration fields for {productname} features and settings are available in the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/configure_red_hat_quay/index[{productname} configuration guide]. 

The following example is one setting that you can change directly in the `config.yaml` file. Use this example as a reference when editing your `config.yaml` file for other features and settings.

[id="add-name-and-company-to-quay-sign-in"]
=== Adding name and company to {productname} sign-in

By setting the `FEATURE_USER_METADATA` field to `true`, users are prompted for their name and company when they first sign in. This is an optional field, but can provide your with extra data about your {productname} users.

Use the following procedure to add a name and a company to the {productname} sign-in page.

.Procedure

. Add, or set, the `FEATURE_USER_METADATA` configuration field to `true` in your `config.yaml` file. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
# ...
FEATURE_USER_METADATA: true
# ...
----

. Redeploy {productname}.

. Now, when prompted to log in, users are requested to enter the following information:

[id="disable-tls-protocols"]
=== Disable TLS Protocols

You can change the `SSL_PROTOCOLS` setting to remove SSL protocols that you do not want to support in your {productname} instance. By default, {productname} is configured to support `TLSv1`, `TLSv1.1`, and `TLSv1.2`.
Use the following procedure to remove TLS v1 support from {productname}.

.Procedure


to remove TLS v1 support from the default `SSL_PROTOCOLS:['TLSv1','TLSv1.1','TLSv1.2']`, change it to the following:

[source,yaml]
----
# ...
SSL_PROTOCOLS : ['TLSv1.1','TLSv1.2']
# ...
----

[id="rate-limit-api-calls"]
=== Rate limit API calls

Adding the `FEATURE_RATE_LIMITS` parameter to the `config.yaml` file causes `nginx` to limit certain API calls to 30-per-second. If `FEATURE_RATE_LIMITS` is not set, API calls are limited to 300-per-second, effectively making them unlimited.

Rate limiting is important when you must ensure that the available resources are not overwhelmed with traffic.

Some namespaces might require unlimited access, for example, if they are important to CI/CD and take priority. In that scenario, those namespaces might be placed in a list in the `config.yaml` file using the `NON_RATE_LIMITED_NAMESPACES`.

[id="adjust-database-connection-pool"]
=== Adjust database connection pooling

{productname} is composed of many different processes which all run within
the same container. Many of these processes interact with the database.

With the `DB_CONNECTION_POOLING` parameter, each process that interacts with the database will contain a connection pool These per-process connection pools are configured to maintain a maximum of 20 connections. When under heavy load, it is possible to fill the connection pool for every process within a {productname} container. Under certain deployments and loads, this might require analysis to ensure that {productname} does not exceed the database's configured maximum connection count.

Over time, the connection pools will release idle connections. To release all connections immediately, {productname} must be restarted.

Database connection pooling can be toggled by setting the `DB_CONNECTION_POOLING` to `true` or `false`. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
---
DB_CONNECTION_POOLING: true
---
----

When `DB_CONNECTION_POOLING` is enabled, you can change the maximum size of the connection pool with the `DB_CONNECTION_ARGS` in your `config.yaml`. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
---
DB_CONNECTION_ARGS:
  max_connections: 10
---
----

[id="database-connection-arguments"]
==== Database connection arguments

You can customize your {productname} database connection settings within the `config.yaml` file. These are dependent on your deployment's database driver, for example, `psycopg2` for Postgres and `pymysql` for MySQL. You can also pass in argument used by Peewee's connection pooling mechanism. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
---
DB_CONNECTION_ARGS:
  max_connections: n  # Max Connection Pool size. (Connection Pooling only)
  timeout: n  # Time to hold on to connections. (Connection Pooling only)
  stale_timeout: n  # Number of seconds to block when the pool is full. (Connection Pooling only)
---
----


[id="database-ssl-configuration"]
==== Database SSL configuration

Some key-value pairs defined under the `DB_CONNECTION_ARGS` field are generic, while others are specific to the database. In particular, SSL configuration depends on the database that you are deploying.

[id="postgres-ssl-connection-arguments"]
===== PostgreSQL SSL connection arguments

The following YAML shows a sample PostgreSQL SSL configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
---
DB_CONNECTION_ARGS:
  sslmode: verify-ca
  sslrootcert: /path/to/cacert
---
----

The `sslmode` parameter determines whether, or with, what priority a secure SSL TCP/IP connection will be negotiated with the server. There are six modes for the `sslmode` parameter:

* **disabl:**: Only try a non-SSL connection.
* **allow**: Try a non-SSL connection first. Upon failure, try an SSL connection.
* **prefer**: Default. Try an SSL connection first. Upon failure, try a non-SSL connection.
* **require**: Only try an SSL connection. If a root CA file is present, verify the connection in the same way as if `verify-ca` was specified.
* **verify-ca**: Only try an SSL connection, and verify that the server certificate is issued by a trust certificate authority (CA).
* **verify-full**: Only try an SSL connection. Verify that the server certificate is issued by a trust CA, and that the requested server host name matches that in the certificate.

For more information about the valid arguments for PostgreSQL, see link:https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html[Database Connection Control Functions].

[id="mysql-ssl-connection-arguments"]
===== MySQL SSL connection arguments

The following YAML shows a sample MySQL SSL configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
---
DB_CONNECTION_ARGS:
  ssl:
    ca: /path/to/cacert
---
----

For more information about the valid connection arguments for MySQL, see link:https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/connecting-using-uri-or-key-value-pairs.html[Connecting to the Server Using URI-Like Strings or Key-Value Pairs].

[id="http-connection-counts"]
==== HTTP connection counts

You can specify the quantity of simultaneous HTTP connections using environment variables. The environment variables can be specified as a whole, or for a specific component. The default for each is 50 parallel connections per process. See the following YAML for example environment variables;

[source,yaml]
----
---
WORKER_CONNECTION_COUNT_REGISTRY=n
WORKER_CONNECTION_COUNT_WEB=n
WORKER_CONNECTION_COUNT_SECSCAN=n
WORKER_CONNECTION_COUNT=n
---
----

[NOTE]
====
Specifying a count for a specific component will override any value
set in the `WORKER_CONNECTION_COUNT` configuration field.
====

[id="dynamic-process-counts"]
==== Dynamic process counts

To estimate the quantity of dynamically sized processes, the following
calculation is used by default.

[NOTE]
====
{productname} queries the available CPU count from the entire machine. Any limits
applied using kubernetes or other non-virtualized mechanisms will not affect
this behavior. {productname} makes its calculation based on the total number of processors on the Node. The default values listed are simply targets, but shall
not exceed the maximum or be lower than the minimum.
====

Each of the following process quantities can be overridden using the
environment variable specified below:

- registry - Provides HTTP endpoints to handle registry action
* minimum: 8
* maximum: 64
* default: $CPU_COUNT x 4
* environment variable: WORKER_COUNT_REGISTRY

- web - Provides HTTP endpoints for the web-based interface
* minimum: 2
* maximum: 32
* default: $CPU_COUNT x 2
* environment_variable: WORKER_COUNT_WEB

- secscan - Interacts with Clair
* minimum: 2
* maximum: 4
* default: $CPU_COUNT x 2
* environment variable: WORKER_COUNT_SECSCAN

[id="environment-variables"]
==== Environment variables

{productname} allows overriding default behavior using environment variables.
The following table lists and describes each variable and the values they can expect.

.Worker count environment variables
[cols="2a,2a,2a",options="header"]
|===
| Variable | Description | Values
| *WORKER_COUNT_REGISTRY* | Specifies the number of processes to handle registry requests within the `Quay` container. | Integer between `8` and `64`
| *WORKER_COUNT_WEB* | Specifies the number of processes to handle UI/Web requests within the container. | Integer between `2` and `32`
| *WORKER_COUNT_SECSCAN* | Specifies the number of processes to handle Security Scanning (for example, Clair) integration within the container. | Integer. Because the Operator specifies 2 vCPUs for resource requests and limits, setting this value between `2` and `4` is safe. However, users can run more, for example, `16`, if warranted.
| *DB_CONNECTION_POOLING* | Toggle database connection pooling. | `true` or `false`
|===

[id="turning-off-connection-pooling"]
==== Turning off connection pooling

{productname} deployments with a large amount of user activity can regularly
hit the 2k maximum database connection limit. In these cases, connection
pooling, which is enabled by default for {productname}, can cause database
connection count to rise exponentially and require you to turn off connection
pooling.

If turning off connection pooling is not enough to prevent hitting the 2k
database connection limit, you need to take additional steps to deal with
the problem. If this happens, you might need to increase the maximum database
connections to better suit your workload.
