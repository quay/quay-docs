= Advanced {productname} configuration

You can configure your {productname} after initial deployment using
several different interfaces:

* The {productname} Config Tool: Running the `quay` container in `config` mode
presents a Web-based interface for configuring the {productname} cluster. This
is the recommended method for most configuration of the {productname} service itself.

* Editing the `config.yaml`: The `config.yaml` file holds most of the configuration
information for the {productname} cluster. Editing that file directly is possible,
but it is only recommended for advanced tuning and performance features that are
not available through the Config Tool.

* {productname} API: Some {productname} configuration can be done through the API.

While configuration for specific features is covered in separate sections, this
section describes how to use each of those interfaces and perform some
more advanced configuration.

== Using {productname} Config Tool to modify {productname}
The {productname} Config Tool is made available by running a `quay` container
in `config` mode alongside the regular {productname} service. Running the
Config Tool is different for {productname} clusters running on OpenShift than
it is for those running directly on host systems.

=== Running the Config Tool from the {productname} Operator
If you are running the {productname} Operator from OpenShift, the Config Tool
is probably already available for you to use. To access the Config Tool,
do the following:

. From the OpenShift console, select the project in which {productname}
is running. For example, quay-enterprise.

. From the left column, select Networking -> Routes. You should see routes to
both the {productname} application and Config Tool, as shown in
the following image:
+
image:configtoolroute.png[View the route to the {productname} Config Tool]

. Select the route to the Config Tool (for example, example-quayecosystem-quay-config) and select it.
The Config tool Web UI should open in your browser.

. Select `Modify configuration for this cluster`. You should see the
Config Tool, ready for you to change features
of your {productname} cluster, as shown in the following image:
+
image:configtoolsetup.png[Modify {productname} cluster settings from the Config Tool]

. When you have made the changes you want, select `Save Configuration Changes`.
The Config Tool will validate your changes.

. Make any corrections as needed by selecting `Continue Editing`
or select `Next` to continue on.

. When prompted, it is recommended that you select `Download Configuration`.
That will download a tarball of your new `config.yaml`, as well as any
certificates and keys used with your {productname} setup.

. Select `Go to deployment rollout`, then
`Populate the configuration to deployments`. The {productname}
pods will be restarted and the changes will take effect.

The `config.yaml` file you saved can be used to make advanced
changes to your configuration or just kept for future reference.

=== Running the Config Tool from the command line
If you are running {productname} directly from a host system,
using tools such as the `podman` or `docker` commands,
after the initial {productname} deployment, you can restart the
Config Tool to modify your {productname} cluster. Here's how:

. **Start quay in config mode**: On the first `quay` node run the following, replacing
`my-secret-password` with your password. If you would like to modify an existing config bundle, 
you can simply mount your configuration directory into the Quay container as you would in registry mode.
+
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
....
# podman run --rm -it --name quay_config -p 8080:8080 \
    -v path/to/config-bundle:/conf/stack \
    {productrepo}/{quayimage}:{productminv} config my-secret-password
....

. **Open browser**: When the quay configuration tool starts up, open a browser to the URL and port 8080
of the system you are running the configuration tool on
(for example https://myquay.example.com:8080). You are prompted for a username and password.

At this point, you can begin modifying your {productname} cluster as described earlier.

[[overview-advanced-config]]
== Using the API to modify {productname}
See the
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html-single/red_hat_quay_api_guide/index[{productname} API Guide] for information on how to access {productname} API.

== Editing the `config.yaml` file to modify {productname}
Some advanced {productname} configuration that is not available through
the Config Tool can be achieved by editing the `config.yaml` file directly.
Available settings are described in the
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html/manage_red_hat_quay/quay-schema[Schema for Red Hat Quay configuration]
The following are examples of settings you can change directly in the `config.yaml` file.

=== Add name and company to {productname} sign-in
Setting the following will cause users to be prompted for their name and
company when they first sign in. Although this is optional, it can provide
you with extra data about your {productname} users:
+
`FEATURE_USER_METADATA: true`

=== Disable TLS Protocols
You can change the SSL_PROTOCOLS setting to remove SSL protocols that you
do not want to support in your {productname} instance. For example, to remove
TLS v1 support from the default
SSL_PROTOCOLS : ['TLSv1','TLSv1.1','TLSv1.2'], change it as follows:
+
SSL_PROTOCOLS : ['TLSv1.1','TLSv1.2']

=== Rate limit API calls

Adding the FEATURE_RATE_LIMITS parameter to the `config.yaml` causes `nginx` to
limit certain API calls to 30 per second. If that feature is not set, API calls
are limied to 300 per second (effectively unlimited).
Rate limiting can be an important feature, if you need to make sure the resources
available are not overwhelmed with traffic.

Some namespace may require unlimited access (perhaps they are important to CI/CD
and take priority, for example). In this case, those namespace may be placed in
a list in `config.yaml` for NON_RATE_LIMITED_NAMESPACES.

=== Adjust database connection pooling

{productname} is composed of many different processes which all run within
the same container. Many of these processes interact with the database.

If enabled, each process that interacts with the database will contain a
connection pool. These per-process connection pools are configured to maintain
a maximum of 20 connections. Under heavy load, it is possible to fill the
connection pool for every process within a {productname} container. Under certain
deployments and loads, this may require analysis to ensure {productname} does not
exceed the database's configured maximum connection count.

Overtime, the connection pools will release idle connections. To release all
connections immediately, {productname} requires a restart.

Database connection pooling may be toggled by setting the environment
variable `DB_CONNECTION_POOLING={true|false}`

If database connection pooling is enabled, it is possible to change the
maximum size of the connection pool. This can be done through the following
`config.yaml` option:

....
DB_CONNECTION_ARGS:
  max_connections: 10
....

==== Database connection arguments

You can customize {productname} database connection settings within the
`config.yaml` file. These are entirely dependent upon the underlying
database driver, such as `psycopg2` for Postgres and `pymysql` for MySQL.
It is also possible to pass in arguments used by Peewee's Connection Pooling
mechanism as seen below.

....
DB_CONNECTION_ARGS:
  max_connections: n  # Max Connection Pool size. (Connection Pooling only)
  timeout: n  # Time to hold on to connections. (Connection Pooling only)
  stale_timeout: n  # Number of seconds to block when the pool is full. (Connection Pooling only)
....

==== HTTP connection counts

It is possible to specify the quantity of simultaneous HTTP connections using
environment variables. These can be specified as a whole, or for a specific
component. The default for each is 50 parallel connections per process.

Environment variables:
- WORKER_CONNECTION_COUNT_REGISTRY=n
- WORKER_CONNECTION_COUNT_WEB=n
- WORKER_CONNECTION_COUNT_SECSCAN=n
- WORKER_CONNECTION_COUNT=n

[Note]
====
Specifying a count for a specific component will override any value
set in WORKER_CONNECTION_COUNT.
====

==== Dynamic process counts

To estimate the quantity of dynamically sized processes, the following
calculation is used by default.

[NOTE]
{productname}  queries the available CPU count from the entire machine. Any limits
applied using kubernetes or other non-virtualized mechanisms will not affect
this behavior; {productname} will makes its calculation based on the total number of
processors on the Node. The default values listed are simply targets, but shall
not exceed the maximum or be lower than the minimum.

Each of the following process quantities can be overridden using the
environment variable specified below.

- registry - Provides HTTP endpoints to handle registry action
* minimum: 8
* maximum: 64
* default: $CPU_COUNT x 4
* environment variable: WORKER_COUNT_REGISTRY

- web - Provides HTTP endpoints for the web-based interface
* minimum: 2
* maximum: 32
* default: $CPU_COUNT x 2
* environment_variable: WORKER_COUNT_WEB

- secscan - Interacts with Clair
* minimum: 2
* maximum: 4
* default: $CPU_COUNT x 2
* environment variable: WORKER_COUNT_SECSCAN

==== Environment variables

{productname} allows overriding default behavior using environment variables.
This table lists and describes each variable and the values they can expect.

.Worker count environment variables
[cols="2a,2a,2a",options="header"]
|===
| Variable | Description | Values
| WORKER_COUNT_REGISTRY | Specifies the number of processes to handle Registry requests within the Quay container. | Integer between 8 and 64
| WORKER_COUNT_WEB | Specifies the number of processes to handle UI/Web requests within the container. | Integer between 2 and 32
| WORKER_COUNT_SECSCAN | Specifies the number of processes to handle Security Scanning (e.g. Clair) integration within the container. | Integer between 2 and 4
| DB_CONNECTION_POOLING | Toggle database connection pooling. In 3.4, it is disabled by default. | "true" or "false"
|===

==== Turning off connection pooling

{productname} deployments with a large amount of user activity can regularly
hit the 2k maximum database connection limit. In these cases, connection
pooling, which is enabled by default for {productname}, can cause database
connection count to rise exponentially and require you to turn off connection
pooling.

If turning off connection pooling is not enough to prevent hitting that 2k
database connection limit, you need to take additional steps to deal with
the problem. In this case you might need to increase the maximum database
connections to better suit your workload.

== Using the configuration API

The configuration tool exposes 4 endpoints that can be used to build, validate,  bundle and deploy a configuration. The config-tool API is documented at link:https://github.com/quay/config-tool/blob/master/pkg/lib/editor/API.md[]. In this section, you will see how to use the API to retrieve the current configuration and how to validate any changes you make.




=== Retrieving the default configuration 

If you are running the configuration tool for the first time, and do not have an existing configuration, you can retrieve the default configuration. Start the container in config mode:

[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
....
$ sudo podman run --rm -it --name quay_config \ 
  -p 8080:8080 \
  {productrepo}/{quayimage}:{productminv} config secret
....

Use the `config` endpoint of the configuration API to get the default:

....
$ curl -X GET -u quayconfig:secret http://quay-server:8080/api/v1/config  | jq
....

The value returned is the default configuration in JSON format:

[source, json]
----
{
  "config.yaml": {
    "AUTHENTICATION_TYPE": "Database",
    "AVATAR_KIND": "local",
    "DB_CONNECTION_ARGS": {
      "autorollback": true,
      "threadlocals": true
    },
    "DEFAULT_TAG_EXPIRATION": "2w",
    "EXTERNAL_TLS_TERMINATION": false,
    "FEATURE_ACTION_LOG_ROTATION": false,
    "FEATURE_ANONYMOUS_ACCESS": true,
    "FEATURE_APP_SPECIFIC_TOKENS": true,
    ....
  }

}
----

=== Retrieving the current configuration

If you have already configured and deployed the Quay registry, stop the container and restart it in configuration mode, loading the existing configuration as a volume:

[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
....
$ sudo podman run --rm -it --name quay_config \ 
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v $QUAY/config:/conf/stack:Z \
  {productrepo}/{quayimage}:{productminv} config secret
....

Use the `config` endpoint of the API to get the current configuration:

....
$ curl -X GET -u quayconfig:secret http://quay-server:8080/api/v1/config  | jq
....


The value returned is the current configuration in JSON format, including database and Redis configuration data:

[source, json]
----
{
  "config.yaml": {
    ....
    "BROWSER_API_CALLS_XHR_ONLY": false,
    "BUILDLOGS_REDIS": {
      "host": "quay-server",
      "password": "strongpassword",
      "port": 6379
    },
    "DATABASE_SECRET_KEY": "4b1c5663-88c6-47ac-b4a8-bb594660f08b",
    "DB_CONNECTION_ARGS": {
      "autorollback": true,
      "threadlocals": true
    },
    "DB_URI": "postgresql://quayuser:quaypass@quay-server:5432/quay",
    "DEFAULT_TAG_EXPIRATION": "2w",
    ....


  }

}
----

=== Validating configuration using the API

You can validate a configuration by posting it to the `config/validate` endpoint:

....
curl -u quayconfig:secret --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --request POST --data '
{
  "config.yaml": {
    ....
    "BROWSER_API_CALLS_XHR_ONLY": false,
    "BUILDLOGS_REDIS": {
      "host": "quay-server",
      "password": "strongpassword",
      "port": 6379
    },
    "DATABASE_SECRET_KEY": "4b1c5663-88c6-47ac-b4a8-bb594660f08b",
    "DB_CONNECTION_ARGS": {
      "autorollback": true,
      "threadlocals": true
    },
    "DB_URI": "postgresql://quayuser:quaypass@quay-server:5432/quay",
    "DEFAULT_TAG_EXPIRATION": "2w",
    ....

  }

} http://quay-server:8080/api/v1/config/validate | jq
....


The returned value is an array containing the errors found in the configuration. If the configuration is valid, an empty array `[]` is returned.


=== Determining the required fields

You can determine the required fields by posting an empty configuration structure to the `config/validate` endpoint:

....
curl -u quayconfig:secret --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --request POST --data '
{
  "config.yaml": {    
  }

} http://quay-server:8080/api/v1/config/validate | jq
....


The value returned is an array indicating which fields are required:

----
[
  {
    "FieldGroup": "Database",
    "Tags": [
      "DB_URI"
    ],
    "Message": "DB_URI is required."
  },
  {
    "FieldGroup": "DistributedStorage",
    "Tags": [
      "DISTRIBUTED_STORAGE_CONFIG"
    ],
    "Message": "DISTRIBUTED_STORAGE_CONFIG must contain at least one storage location."
  },
  {
    "FieldGroup": "HostSettings",
    "Tags": [
      "SERVER_HOSTNAME"
    ],
    "Message": "SERVER_HOSTNAME is required"
  },
  {
    "FieldGroup": "HostSettings",
    "Tags": [
      "SERVER_HOSTNAME"
    ],
    "Message": "SERVER_HOSTNAME must be of type Hostname"
  },
  {
    "FieldGroup": "Redis",
    "Tags": [
      "BUILDLOGS_REDIS"
    ],
    "Message": "BUILDLOGS_REDIS is required"
  }
]
----
