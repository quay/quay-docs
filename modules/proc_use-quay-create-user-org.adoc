= Creating {product-title} users and organizations

Before you begin creating repositories to hold your container images
in {product-title}, you should consider how you want to organize those
repositories. Every repository in a {product-title} instance must be
associated with one of the following:

* **User**: A user account lets you log in to your {product-title}
instance, either through the web UI or through a container client
(such as `docker login`). When you create a repo, its name is associated
with your account, such as: `myquay.example.com/<user>/<repo>`. Once you
create that repo, you can allow other {product-title} user accounts or
what are referred to as `robot` accounts to access the repo.

* **Organization**: Although you need superuser privilege to create user
accounts, any user can create organizations to efficiently share
repositories among groups of users. An organization is like a user account,
in that you can define access to your repos for other user and robot
accounts. However, you can also add access to sets of users referred to as
`teams`. A repository created under an organization would look similar to the
following: `myquay.example.com/<org>/<repo>`

The following sections describe how to create user accounts and organizations
to {product-title}. Creating user accounts requires superuser privileges.

== Creating user accounts
To create a new user for your {product-title} instance:

. Log in to {product-title} as the superuser (quay by default).
. Select your account name from the upper right corner of the home page and choose Super User Admin Panel.
. Select the Users icon from the left column.
. Select the Create User button.
. Enter the new user’s Username and Email address, then select the Create User button.
. Back on the Users page, select the Options icon to the right of the new Username. A drop-down menu appears, as shown in the following figure:

. Choose Change Password from the menu.
. Add the new password and verify it, then select the Change User Password button.

The new user can now use that username and password to log in via the web ui or through some container client.

== Creating organization accounts

Any user can create their own organization to share repositories of
container images. To create a new organization:

. While logged in as any user, select the plus sign (+) from the upper
right corner of the home page and choose New Organization.
. Type the name of the organization. The name must be alphanumeric, all
lower case, and between 2 and 255 characters long
. Select Create Organization. The new organization appears, ready for you
to begin adding repositories, teams, robot accounts and other features
from icons on the left column. The following figure shows an example of the new
organization’s page with the settings tab selected.
