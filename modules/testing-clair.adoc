= Testing Clair


















////

Currently, there are two methods for testing Clair independently of a {productname} subscription:

* In a local development environment
* In a distributed deployment

[IMPORTANT]
====
Official documentation for testing Clair without a {productname} subscription is unsupported. These procedures and subsequent updates are maintained by upstream contributors and developers. For more information, see link:https://quay.github.io/clair/howto/getting_started.html[Getting Started With ClairV4].

[id="testing-clair-local-development-environment"]
== Testing Clair in a local development environment 

The simplest way to run Clair for test purposes is to use the local development environment. The local development environment can be used to test and develop Clair's integration with {productname}. Documentation for this procedure can be found on the open source Clair project at link:https://quay.github.io/clair/howto/testing.html[Testing ClairV4]. 

[id="clair-modes"]
== Testing Clair in a distributed deployment 

When testing Clair in a distributed deployment, Clair uses PostgreSQL for its data persistence. Clair migrations are supported. Users can point Clair to a fresh database to set it up.  

In a distributed deployment, users can test run Clair in the following modes: 

* Indexer mode. When Clair is running in indexer mode, it is responsible for receiving manifests and generating `IndexReports`. An `IndexReport` is an intermediate representation of a manifest's content and is used to discover vulnerabilities. 

* Matcher mode. When Clair is running in matcher mode, it is responsible for receiving `IndexReports` and generating `VulnerabilityReports`. A `VulnerabilityReport` describes the contents of a manifest and any vulnerabilities affecting it. 

* Notifier mode. When Clair is running in notifier mode, it is responsible for generating notifications when new vulnerabilities affecting a previously indexed manifest enter the system. The notifier will send notifications through the configured mechanisms.

* Combination mode. When Clair is running in combination mode, the `indexer`, `matcher`, and `notifier` each run on a single OS process. 

[NOTE]
====
These modes are available when running Clair with a {productname} subscription.
