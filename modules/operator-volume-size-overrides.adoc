= Volume size overrides

You can specify the desired size of storage resources provisioned for managed components. The default size for Clair and the PostgreSQL databases is `50Gi`. You can now choose a large enough capacity upfront, either for performance reasons or in the case where your storage backend does not have resize capability.

In the following example, the volume size for the Clair and the Quay PostgreSQL databases has been set to `70Gi`:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: quay.redhat.com/v1
kind: QuayRegistry
metadata:
  name: quay-example
  namespace: quay-enterprise
spec:
  configBundleSecret: config-bundle-secret
  components:
    - kind: objectstorage
      managed: false
    - kind: route
      managed: true
    - kind: tls
      managed: false
    - kind: clair
      managed: true
      overrides:
        volumeSize: 70Gi
    - kind: postgres
      managed: true
      overrides:
        volumeSize: 70Gi
    - kind: clairpostgres
      managed: true

[NOTE]
====
The volume size of the `clairpostgres` component cannot be overridden. To override the `clairpostgres` component, you must override the `clair` component. This is a known issue and will be fixed in a future version of {productname}. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-4301[*PROJQUAY-4301*])
