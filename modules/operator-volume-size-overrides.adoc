= Volume size overrides

As of {productname} v3.6.2, you can specify the desired size of storage resources provisioned for managed components. The default size for Clair and Quay PostgreSQL databases is `50Gi`. You can now choose a large enough capacity upfront, either for performance reasons or in the case where your storage backend does not have resize capability.


In the following example, the volume size for the Clair and the Quay PostgreSQL databases has been set to `70Gi`:
