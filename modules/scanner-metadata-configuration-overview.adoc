= Scanner and Metadata

This section describes configuration fields related to security scanning, metadata presentation, and artifact relationships within {productname}.

These settings enable enhanced visibility and security by allowing {productname} to:

* Integrate with a vulnerability scanner to assess container images for known CVEs.
* Render AI/ML model metadata through model cards stored in the registry.
* Expose relationships between container artifacts using the Referrers API, aligning with the OCI artifact specification.

Together, these features help improve software supply chain transparency, enforce security policies, and support emerging metadata-driven workflows.
