{productname} can integrate with almost all Git-compatible systems. {productname} offers automative configuration for GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket, which allows users to continuously build and serve their containerized software.

[id="arch-rest-api"]
== REST API

{productname} provides a full OAuth 2, RESTful API. RESTful API offers the following benefits:

* Availability from endpoints of each {productname} instance from the URL, for example, `\https://quay-server.example.com/api/v1`
* Allow users to connect to endpoints through a browser, to `GET`, `DELETE`, `POST`, and `PUT` {productname} settings provided by a discovery endpoint that is usable by Swagger.
* The API can be invoked by the URL, for example, `\https://quay-server.example.com/api/v1`, and uses JSON objects as payload.
