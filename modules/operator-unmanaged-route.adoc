= Disabling Route Component

To prevent the Operator from creating a `Route`: 

. Mark the component as unmanaged in the `QuayRegistry`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: quay.redhat.com/v1
kind: QuayRegistry
metadata:
  name: example-registry
  namespace: quay-enterprise
spec:
  components:
    - kind: route
      managed: false
----

. Specify that you want Quay to handle TLS in the configuration, by editing the `config.yaml` file:
+
.config.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
...
EXTERNAL_TLS_TERMINATION: false
...
SERVER_HOSTNAME: example-registry-quay-quay-enterprise.apps.user1.example.com
...
PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME: https
...
----
+
If you do not configure the unmanaged Route correctly, you will see an error similar to the following: 
+
[source,json]
----
{
  {
    "kind":"QuayRegistry",
    "namespace":"quay-enterprise",
    "name":"example-registry",
    "uid":"d5879ba5-cc92-406c-ba62-8b19cf56d4aa",
    "apiVersion":"quay.redhat.com/v1",
    "resourceVersion":"2418527"
  },
  "reason":"ConfigInvalid",
  "message":"required component `route` marked as unmanaged, but `configBundleSecret` is missing necessary fields"
}
----


[NOTE]
====
Disabling the default `Route` means you are now responsible for creating a `Route`, `Service`, or `Ingress` in order to access the Quay instance and that whatever DNS you use must match the `SERVER_HOSTNAME` in the Quay config.
