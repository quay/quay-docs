= Disabling Route Component

To prevent the Operator from creating a `Route`, mark the component as unmanaged in the `QuayRegistry`:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: quay.redhat.com/v1
kind: QuayRegistry
metadata:
  name: example-registry
  namespace: quay-enterprise
spec:
  components:
    - kind: route
      managed: false
----

[NOTE]
====
Disabling the default `Route` means you are now responsible for creating a `Route`, `Service`, or `Ingress` in order to access the Quay instance and that whatever DNS you use must match the `SERVER_HOSTNAME` in the Quay config.
