= {productname} robot accounts

Robot accounts are named tokens that hold credentials for accessing external repositories. By assigning credentials to a robot, that robot can be used across multiple mirrored repositories that need to access the same external registry.

Robot accounts are managed on the *Robot Accounts* tab. They can only belong to one organization, but can be assigned to multiple Teams. 

[NOTE]
====
Teams and users can belong to multiple organizations.
