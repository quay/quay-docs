= Troubleshooting the configuration file

Failure to add all of the required configuration field, or to provide the proper information for some parameters, might result in the `quay-registry` container failing to deploy. Use the following procedure to view and troubleshoot a failed on premise deployment type.

.Prerequisites

* You have created a minimal configuration file.

.Procedure

* Attempt to deploy the `quay-registry` container by entering the following command. Note that this command uses the `-it`, which shows you debugging information:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman run -it --rm -p 80:8080 -p 443:8443 --name=quay -v /home/<username>/<quay-deployment-directory>/config:/conf/stack:Z    -v /home/<username>/<quay-deployment-directory>/storage:/datastorage:Z 33f1c3dc86be

In this example, the `quay-registry` container failed to deploy because improper LDAP credentials were provided.
