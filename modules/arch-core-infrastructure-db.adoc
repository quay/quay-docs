= Database backend

Quay stores most of its configuration and all metadata and logs inside its database backend. Logs can be pushed into ElasticSearch instead

PostgreSQL is the preferred database backend since it can be used for both Quay and Clair

Quay works fine with MySQL too (5.7+) but Clair requires PostgreSQL

Quay HA requires an HA database setup

If Quay is running on public cloud infrastructure, we recommend the use of the PostgreSQL services provided by your cloud provider.

Geo-replication requires a single, shared database that is accessible from all regions
