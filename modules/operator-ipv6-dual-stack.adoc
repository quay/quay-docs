= Deploying IPv6 on {productname-ocp}

[role="_abstract"]
IPv6 support lets you deploy {productname-ocp} in IPv6-only environments such as Telco and Edge deployments. You can enable IPv6 by setting the `FEATURE_LISTEN_IP_VERSION` parameter to IPv6 in your `config.yaml` file.

For a list of known limitations, see IPv6 limitations.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, deploying IPv6 on the {productname-ocp} is not supported on IBM Power and IBM Z.
