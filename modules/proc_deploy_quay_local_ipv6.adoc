= Configuring the Podman CNI to use IPv6

In some cases, you might want to run a local instance of {productname} to use IPv6. This setup is common for development or testing purposes.

By default, the Podman network for a root user does not use IPv6, and instead defaults to use IPv4. You can configure the Podman Container Network Interface (CNI) to use both IPv4 and IPv6, which allows for a local instance of {productname} using IPv6.
