= Configuring podman to trust the Certificate Authority

Podman uses two paths to locate the CA file, namely, `/etc/containers/certs.d/` and `/etc/docker/certs.d/`. Copy the root CA file to one of these locations, with the exact path determined by the server hostname, and naming the file `ca.crt`:


```
sudo cp rootCA.pem /etc/containers/certs.d/quay-server.example.com/ca.crt
```

Alternatively, if you have are using Docker, you can copy the root CA file to the equivalent Docker directory:

```
sudo cp rootCA.pem /etc/docker/certs.d/quay-server.example.com/ca.crt
```

You should no longer need to use the `--tls-verify=false` option when logging in to the registry:

```
sudo podman login quay-server.example.com

Username: quayadmin
Password: 
Login Succeeded!
```
