* The following enhancements have been made to the {productname} proxy cache feature: 

** Previously, the cache of a proxy organization with quota management enabled could reach full capacity. Consequently, pulls for new images could be prevented until an administrator cleaned up the cached images. 
+
With this update, {productname} administrators can now leverage the storage quota of an organization to limit the cache size. This ensures that backend storage consumption remains predictable by discarding images from the cache according to the image's pull frequency or overall usage. As a result, the storage size allotted by quota management always within its limits. 
+
For more information, see link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-3042[PROJQUAY-3042] and link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-3063[PROJQUAY-3063]. 

////

* The following configuration fields have been added to enhance the super user role: 

** **LDAP_SUPERUSER_FILTER**: This configuration field is a subset of the `LDAP_USER_FILTER` configuration field. It allows {productname} administrators the ability to configure Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) users as super users when {productname} uses LDAP as its authentication provider.
+
With this field, administrators can add or remove super users without having to update the {productname} configuration file and restart their deployment. 

** **FEATURE_SUPERUSERS_FULL_ACCESS**: This configuration field grants super users the ability to read, write, and delete content from other repositories in namespaces that they do not own or have explicit permissions for. 

* The following configuration fields have been added for user permissions: 

** **FEATURE_RESTRICTED_USERS**: This configuration field restricts normal users from creating organizations and reading and writing content. 

** **RESTRICTED_USERS_WHITELIST**: With this configuration field enabled, administrators can exclude users from the `FEATURE_RESTRICTED_USERS` setting. 


////
* The following enhancements have been made to user permissions:

** Previously, {productname} did not allow global access for any user, including super users. This update adds the ability to create users with global read-only access. Users with read-only access can see all repositories and image across any namespace and any organization. For more information, see link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-2604[PROJQUAY-2604]. 

* The following changes have been made to user permissions:

** {productname} administrators can now limit normal users from creating organization in {productname} and assign this option to specific users. For more information, see link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-402[PROJQUAY-402]. 
////


Known issues:

* Currently, attempting to configure your {productname} deployment with the common Azure Blob Storage configuration will not work on IPv6 single stack environments. Because the endpoint of Azure Blob Storage does not support IPv6, there is no workaround in place for this issue.
+
For more information, see link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-4433[PROJQUAY-4433]. 


=== {productname} Operator 

The following updates have been made to the {productname} Operator: 

* IPv6 support is now available in {productname} {producty} Operator deployments. With this feature, the {productname} Operator can now be deployed in IPv4 and IPv6 dual-stack OpenShift Container Platform clusters where {productname} uses IPv6.  


=== {productname} feature tracker

New features have been added to {productname}, some of which are currently in Technology Preview. Technology Preview features are experimental features and are not intended for production use.

Some features available in previous releases have been deprecated or removed. Deprecated functionality is still included in {productname}, but is planned for removal in a future release and is not recommended for new deployments. For the most recent list of deprecated and removed functionality in {productname}, refer to Table 1.1. Additional details for more fine-grained functionality that has been deprecated and removed are listed after the table.

//This will eventually expand to cover the latest three releases. Since this is the first TP tracker, it will include only 3.6.
