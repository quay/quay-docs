= On prem {productname} configuration overview

For on premise deployments of {productname}, the `config.yaml` file that is managed by the administrator is mounted into the container at startup and read by {productname} during initialization. The `config.yaml` file is not dynamically reloaded, meaning that any changes made to the file require restarting the registry container to take effect.

This chapter provides an overview of the following concepts:

* The minimal required configuration fields.
* How to edit and manage your configuration after deployment.

This section applies specifically to on premise {productname} deployment types. For information about configuring {productname-ocp}, see "{productname-ocp} configuration overview".
