= Disabling the monitoring component

[role="_abstract"]
Disabling the monitoring component sets the monitoring component to unmanaged in the `QuayRegistry` custom resource. You must disable monitoring when you install the {productname} Operator in a single namespace, or you can disable it in multi-namespace installations to use your own monitoring stack.

[NOTE]
====
Monitoring cannot be enabled when the {productname} Operator is installed in a single namespace.

You might also disable monitoring in multi-namespace deployments if you use an external Prometheus or Grafana instance, want to reduce resource overhead, or require custom observability integration.
