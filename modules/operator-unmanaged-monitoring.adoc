= Disabling the monitoring component

[role="_abstract"]
When installed in a single namespace, the `monitoring` component of the {productname} Operator must be set to `managed: false`, because it does not have permission to create cluster-wide monitoring resources. You can also explicitly disable monitoring in a multi-namespace installation if you prefer to use your own monitoring stack.

[NOTE]
====
Monitoring cannot be enabled when the {productname} Operator is installed in a single namespace.

You might also disable monitoring in multi-namespace deployments if you use an external Prometheus or Grafana instance, want to reduce resource overhead, or require custom observability integration.
