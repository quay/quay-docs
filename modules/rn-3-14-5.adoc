== {productname} 3.14.5 bug fixes

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-5880[PROJQUAY-5880]. Before this update, {productname} remapping of non-Docker compatible characters in `LDAP_UID_ATTR` caused incorrect LDAP searches for user permissions. As a consequence, user permissions were incorrectly assigned. With this release, the LDAP search query uses the user's LDAP UID instead of the {productname} username. As a result, Quay correctly searches for user info based on LDAP ID, ensuring that information is accurately returned.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-7270[PROJQUAY-7270]. Before this update, the error message for on-premise customer instances incorrectly suggested the Red{nbsp}Hat status page for support. As a consequence, end users were directed to an incorrect support page, causing confusion and potential delay in issue resolution. With this release, the error message no longer recommends navigating to the Red{nbsp}Hat status page, and instead suggests to contact an organization administrator. 

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-8879[PROJQUAY-8879]. Before this update, in LDAP {productname} environments, when users would log in for the first time with a username like `u.user`. {productname} automatically suggested and created a namespace in the form of `u_user`. As a consequence, usernames with dots (`.`) could not be found by superusers due to the discrepancy between the username and the namespace name. With this release, Quay now uses the actual LDAP username for user filtering. As a result, the LDAP user filter now correctly queries by actual username, resolving `not found` errors.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-9362[PROJQUAY-9362]. With this release, the SQLite driver now supports multiple client access, preventing database locking. As a result, multiple users can access the SQLite database concurrently, improving system efficiency.
