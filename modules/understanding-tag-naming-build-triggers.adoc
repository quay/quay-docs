= Tag naming for build triggers

[role="_abstract"]
Tag naming for build triggers in {product-title} lets you create custom tags using templates that include commit information such as SHA, branch name, author, and date. You can use these templates to automatically tag your built images with meaningful identifiers based on the Git commit that triggered the build.

One option is to include any string of characters assigned as a tag for each built image. Alternatively, you can use the following tag templates on the *Configure Tagging* section of the build trigger to tag images with information from each commit:

image:custom-tagging.png[Configure Tagging]

* *${commit}*: Full SHA of the issued commit
* *${parsed_ref.branch}*: Branch information (if available)
* *${parsed_ref.tag}*: Tag information (if available)
* *${parsed_ref.remote}*: The remote name
* *${commit_info.date}*: Date when the commit was issued
* *${commit_info.author.username}*: Username of the author of the commit
* *${commit_info.short_sha}*: First 7 characters of the commit SHA
* *${committer.properties.username}*: Username of the committer

This list is not complete, but does contain the most useful options for tagging purposes. You can find the complete tag template schema on link:https://github.com/quay/quay/blob/abfde5b9d2cf7d7145e68a00c9274011b4fe0661/buildtrigger/basehandler.py#L96-L195[this page].
