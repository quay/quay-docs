= Tag naming for build triggers

Custom tags are available for use in
ifeval::["{context}" == "quay-io"]
{quayio}.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{context}" == "use-quay"]
{productname}. 
endif::[]
ifeval::["{context}" == "quay-builders-image-automation"]
{productname}. 
endif::[]

One option is to include any string of characters assigned as a tag for each built image. Alternatively, you can use the following tag templates on the *Configure Tagging* section of the build trigger to tag images with information from each commit:

image:custom-tagging.png[Configure Tagging]

* *${commit}*: Full SHA of the issued commit
* *${parsed_ref.branch}*: Branch information (if available)
* *${parsed_ref.tag}*: Tag information (if available)
* *${parsed_ref.remote}*: The remote name
* *${commit_info.date}*: Date when the commit was issued
* *${commit_info.author.username}*: Username of the author of the commit
* *${commit_info.short_sha}*: First 7 characters of the commit SHA
* *${committer.properties.username}*: Username of the committer

This list is not complete, but does contain the most useful options for tagging purposes. You can find the complete tag template schema on link:https://github.com/quay/quay/blob/abfde5b9d2cf7d7145e68a00c9274011b4fe0661/buildtrigger/basehandler.py#L96-L195[this page].
