= Common Product Enumeration mapping in Clair

[role="_abstract"]
Clair uses Common Product Enumeration (CPE) mapping files to map RPM packages to security data for accurate vulnerability scanning of {rhel} container images. Understanding how Clair utilizes these files ensures that your vulnerability reports remain accurate and comprehensive.

The scanner requires the CPE file to be present and accessible to process RPM packages properly. If these files are missing or inaccessible, RPM packages installed in the container image are skipped during the scanning process.

By default, the Clair indexer includes the `repos2cpe` and `names2repos` data files within the Clair container. This allows you to reference local paths such as `/data/repository-to-cpe.json` without additional external configuration.

[IMPORTANT]
====
While Red{nbsp}Hat Product Security updates CPE files regularly, the versions bundled within the Clair container are only updated during {productname} releases. This can lead to temporary discrepancies between the latest security data and the versions bundled with your current installation.
