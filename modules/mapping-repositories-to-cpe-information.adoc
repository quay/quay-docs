= Mapping repositories to Common Product Enumeration information

[NOTE]
====
Currently, mapping repositories to Common Product Enumeration information is not supported on IBM Power and IBM Z.
====

Clair's {rhel} scanner relies on a Common Product Enumeration (CPE) file to map RPM packages to the corresponding security data to produce matching results. Red{nbsp}Hat Product Security maintains and regularly updates these files.

The CPE file must be present, or access to the file must be allowed, for the scanner to properly process RPM packages. If the file is not present, RPM packages installed in the container image will not be scanned.

.Clair CPE mapping files
[options="header"]
|===
|CPE | Link to JSON mapping file
| `repos2cpe` | link:https://www.redhat.com/security/data/metrics/repository-to-cpe.json[Red Hat Repository-to-CPE JSON]
| `names2repos` | link:https://access.redhat.com/security/data/metrics/container-name-repos-map.json[Red Hat Name-to-Repos JSON].
|===

By default, Clair's indexer includes the `repos2cpe` and `names2repos` data files within the Clair container. This means that you can reference `/data/repository-to-cpe.json` and `/data/container-name-repos-map.json` in your `clair-config.yaml` file without the need for additional configuration. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
Although Red{nbsp}Hat Product Security updates the `repos2cpe` and `names2repos` files regularly, the versions included in the `Clair` container are only updated with {productname} releases (for example, version 3.14.1 -> 3.14.2). This can lead to discrepancies between the latest CPE files and those bundled with Clair."

== Mapping repositories to Common Product Enumeration example configuration

Use the `repo2cpe_mapping_file` and `name2repos_mapping_file` fields in your Clair configuration to include the CPE JSON mapping files. For example:

[source,yaml]

    repo:
