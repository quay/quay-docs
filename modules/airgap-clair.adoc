= Using Clair in air-gapped environments

By default, Clair will attempt to run automated updates against Red Hat servers. To run Clair in network environments that are disconnected from the internet:

* Disable Clair auto-update in the Clair configuration bundle
* Manually update the vulnerability database on a system with internet access and then export to disk
* Transfer the on-disk data to the target system using offline media and then manually import it into Clair


Using Clair in air-gapped environments is fully containerized and, as a result, is easy to automate.
