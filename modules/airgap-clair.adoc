= Using Clair in air-gapped environments

By default, Clair tries to run automated updates against Red Hat servers. To run Clair in network environments that are disconnected from the internet, you must execute the following actions:

* Disable Clair auto-update in the Clair configuration bundle.
* Manually update the vulnerability database on a system with internet access and then export to disk.
* Transfer the on-disk data to the target system using offline media, and then manually import it into Clair.

Using Clair in air-gapped environments is fully containerized and, as a result, is easy to automate.
