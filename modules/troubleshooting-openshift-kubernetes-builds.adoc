[role="_abstract"]
To troubleshoot {ocp} and Kubernetes builds in {product-title}, you can create a port forwarding tunnel to the builder pod and access it via SSH. Check the quay-builder service logs to diagnose build issues.

+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc port-forward <builder_pod> 9999:2222
----

. Establish an SSH connection to the remote host using a specified SSH key and port, for example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ssh -i /path/to/ssh/key/set/in/ssh_authorized_keys -p 9999 core@localhost
----

. Obtain the `quay-builder` service logs by entering the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ systemctl status quay-builder
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ journalctl -f -u quay-builder
