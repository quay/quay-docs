== Set Up Ceph
For this {productname} configuration, we create a three-node Ceph cluster, with
several other supporting nodes, as follows:

* ceph01, ceph02, and ceph03 - Ceph Monitor, Ceph Manager and Ceph OSD nodes
* ceph04 - Ceph RGW node
* ceph05 - Ceph Ansible administration node

For details on installing Ceph nodes, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ceph_storage/{producty}/html-single/installation_guide_for_red_hat_enterprise_linux[Installing Red Hat Ceph Storage on Red Hat Enterprise Linux].

Once you have set up the Ceph storage cluster, create a Ceph Object Gateway (also referred to as a RADOS gateway). See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ceph_storage/{producty}/html/installation_guide_for_red_hat_enterprise_linux/deploying-red-hat-ceph-storage#installing-the-ceph-object-gateway[Installing the Ceph Object Gateway] for details.

=== Install each Ceph node
On ceph01, ceph02, ceph03, ceph04, and ceph05, do the following:

. Review prerequisites for setting up Ceph nodes in link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ceph_storage/{producty}/html-single/installation_guide_for_red_hat_enterprise_linux/index#requirements-for-installing-rhcs[Requirements for Installing Red Hat Ceph Storage]. In particular:
+
* Decide if you want to use link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ceph_storage/{producty}/html-single/installation_guide_for_red_hat_enterprise_linux/index#considerations-for-using-a-raid-controller-with-osd-nodes[RAID controllers on OSD nodes].
+
* Decide if you want a separate cluster network for your link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ceph_storage/{producty}/html-single/installation_guide_for_red_hat_enterprise_linux/index#verifying-the-network-configuration-for-red-hat-ceph-storage[Ceph Network Configuration].

. Prepare OSD storage (ceph01, ceph02, and ceph03 only). Set up the OSD storage
on the three OSD nodes (ceph01, ceph02, and ceph03). See OSD Ansible Settings
in link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ceph_storage/{producty}/html-single/installation_guide_for_red_hat_enterprise_linux/index#installing-a-red-hat-ceph-storage-cluster[Table 3.2]
for details on supported storage types that you will enter into your Ansible
configuration later.  For this example, a single, unformatted block device
(`/dev/sdb`), that is separate from the operating system, is configured on each
of the OSD nodes. If you are installing on metal, you might want to add an extra hard drive to the machine for this purpose.

. Install Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server edition, as described in the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html-single/installation_guide/[RHEL 7 Installation Guide].

. Register and subscribe each Ceph node as described in the  link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ceph_storage/{producty}/html-single/installation_guide_for_red_hat_enterprise_linux/#registering-red-hat-ceph-storage-nodes-to-cdn-and-attaching-subscriptions[Registering Red Hat Ceph Storage Nodes]. Here is how to subscribe to the necessary repos:

+
```
# subscription-manager repos --disable=*
# subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-rpms
# subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
# subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-rhceph-3-mon-rpms
# subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-rhceph-3-osd-rpms
# subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-rhceph-3-tools-rpms
```

. Create an ansible user with root privilege on each node. Choose any name you like. For example:
+
```
# USER_NAME=ansibleadmin
# useradd $USER_NAME -c "Ansible administrator"
# passwd $USER_NAME
New password: *********
Retype new password: *********
# cat << EOF >/etc/sudoers.d/admin
admin ALL = (root) NOPASSWD:ALL
EOF
# chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/$USER_NAME
```

=== Configure the Ceph Ansible node (ceph05)
Log into the Ceph Ansible node (ceph05) and configure it as follows. You will need the ceph01, ceph02, and ceph03 nodes to be running to complete these steps.

. In the Ansible user's home directory create a directory to store
temporary values created from the ceph-ansible playbook
+
```
# USER_NAME=ansibleadmin
# sudo su - $USER_NAME
[ansibleadmin@ceph05 ~]$ mkdir ~/ceph-ansible-keys
```

. Enable password-less ssh for the ansible user. Run ssh-keygen on
ceph05 (leave passphrase empty), then run and repeat ssh-copy-id to
copy the public key to the Ansible user on ceph01, ceph02, and ceph03
systems:
+
```
# USER_NAME=ansibleadmin
# sudo su - $USER_NAME
[ansibleadmin@ceph05 ~]$ ssh-keygen
[ansibleadmin@ceph05 ~]$ ssh-copy-id $USER_NAME@ceph01
[ansibleadmin@ceph05 ~]$ ssh-copy-id $USER_NAME@ceph02
[ansibleadmin@ceph05 ~]$ ssh-copy-id $USER_NAME@ceph03
[ansibleadmin@ceph05 ~]$ exit
#
```
. Install the ceph-ansible package:
+
```
# yum install ceph-ansible
```
. Create a symbolic between these two directories:
+
```
# ln -s /usr/share/ceph-ansible/group_vars \
    /etc/ansible/group_vars
```
. Create copies of Ceph sample yml files to modify:
+
```
# cd /usr/share/ceph-ansible
# cp group_vars/all.yml.sample group_vars/all.yml
# cp group_vars/osds.yml.sample group_vars/osds.yml
# cp site.yml.sample site.yml
```
. Edit the copied group_vars/all.yml file. See General Ansible Settings in
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ceph_storage/{producty}/html-single/installation_guide_for_red_hat_enterprise_linux/index#installing-a-red-hat-ceph-storage-cluster[Table 3.1] for details. For example:
+
```
ceph_origin: repository
ceph_repository: rhcs
ceph_repository_type: cdn
ceph_rhcs_version: 3
monitor_interface: eth0
public_network: 192.168.122.0/24
```
+
Note that your network device and address range may differ.
. Edit the copied `group_vars/osds.yml` file. See the OSD Ansible Settings in
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ceph_storage/{producty}/html-single/installation_guide_for_red_hat_enterprise_linux/index#installing-a-red-hat-ceph-storage-cluster[Table 3.2] for details. In this example, the second disk device (`/dev/sdb`) on each OSD node is
used for both data and journal storage:
+
```
osd_scenario: collocated
devices:
  - /dev/sdb
dmcrypt: true
osd_auto_discovery: false
```

. Edit the `/etc/ansible/hosts` inventory file to identify the Ceph nodes as
Ceph monitor, OSD and manager nodes. In this example, the storage devices are
identified on each node as well:
+
```
[mons]
ceph01
ceph02
ceph03

[osds]
ceph01 devices="[ '/dev/sdb' ]"
ceph02 devices="[ '/dev/sdb' ]"
ceph03 devices="[ '/dev/sdb' ]"

[mgrs]
ceph01 devices="[ '/dev/sdb' ]"
ceph02 devices="[ '/dev/sdb' ]"
ceph03 devices="[ '/dev/sdb' ]"
```
. Add this line to the `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg` file, to save the output from
each Ansible playbook run into your Ansible user's home directory:
+
```
retry_files_save_path = ~/
```
. Check that Ansible can reach all the Ceph nodes you configured as your
Ansible user:
+
```
# USER_NAME=ansibleadmin
# sudo su - $USER_NAME
[ansibleadmin@ceph05 ~]$ ansible all -m ping
ceph01 | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
ceph02 | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
ceph03 | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
[ansibleadmin@ceph05 ~]$
```
. Run the ceph-ansible playbook (as your Ansible user):
+
```
[ansibleadmin@ceph05 ~]$ cd /usr/share/ceph-ansible/
[ansibleadmin@ceph05 ~]$ ansible-playbook site.yml
```
+
At this point, the Ansible playbook will check your Ceph nodes and configure
them for the services you requested. If anything fails, make needed corrections
and rerun the command.

. Log into one of the three Ceph nodes (ceph01, ceph02, or ceph03) and check the health of the Ceph cluster:
+
```
# ceph health
HEALTH_OK
```
. On the same node, verify that monitoring is working using rados:
+
```
# ceph osd pool create test 8
# echo 'Hello World!' > hello-world.txt
# rados --pool test put hello-world hello-world.txt
# rados --pool test get hello-world fetch.txt
# cat fetch.txt
Hello World!
```

=== Install the Ceph Object Gateway
On the Ansible system (ceph05), configure a
Ceph Object Gateway to your Ceph Storage cluster (which will ultimately run on ceph04). See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ceph_storage/{producty}/html/installation_guide_for_red_hat_enterprise_linux/deploying-red-hat-ceph-storage#installing-the-ceph-object-gateway[Installing the Ceph Object Gateway] for details.
