= Proxy cache limitations

Proxy caching with {productname} has the following limitations:

* Your proxy cache must have a size limit of greater than, or equal to, the image you want to cache. For example, if your proxy cache organization has a maximum size of 500 MB, and the image a user wants to pull is 700 MB, the image will be cached and will overflow beyond the configured limit.

* Cached images must have the same properties that images on a Quay repository must have.

* Currently, only layers requested by the client are cached.
