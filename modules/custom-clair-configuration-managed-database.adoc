= Running a custom Clair configuration with a managed Clair database

In some cases, users might want to run a custom Clair configuration with a managed Clair database. This is useful in the following scenarios:

* When a user wants to disable specific updater resources.
* When a user is running {productname} in an disconnected environment. For more information about running Clair in a disconnected environment, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html-single/deploy_red_hat_quay_on_openshift_with_the_quay_operator/index#clair-openshift-airgap-database[Configuring access to the Clair database in the air-gapped OpenShift cluster].

[NOTE]
====
* If you are running {productname} in an disconnected environment, the `airgap` parameter of your `clair-config.yaml` must be set to `true`.
* If you are running {productname} in an disconnected environment, you should disable all updater components.
