= Running a custom Clair configuration with a managed Clair database

[role="_abstract"]
Running a custom Clair configuration with a managed Clair database lets you customize Clair settings while the Operator manages the database. You can use this approach to disable specific updater resources or configure Clair for disconnected environments.

[NOTE]
====
* If you are running {productname} in an disconnected environment, the `airgap` parameter of your `clair-config.yaml` must be set to `True`.
* If you are running {productname} in an disconnected environment, you should disable all updater components.
