*Default:* `True`

| **FEATURE_LISTEN_IP_VERSION** | String | Enables IPv4, IPv6, or dual-stack protocol family. This configuration field must be properly set, otherwise {productname} fails to start. 

*Default:* `IPv4`

*Additional configurations:* `IPv6`, `dual-stack`

| **LDAP_SUPERUSER_FILTER** | String | Subset of the `LDAP_USER_FILTER` configuration field. When configured, allows {productname} administrators the ability to configure Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) users as superusers when {productname} uses LDAP as its authentication provider.

With this field, administrators can add or remove superusers without having to update the {productname} configuration file and restart their deployment.

Normal permissions apply for an organization's membership, for example, a restricted user will still have normal permissions in organizations based on the teams that they are members of.
