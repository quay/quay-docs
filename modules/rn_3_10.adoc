Fixed:

* Ensure robot accounts being granted access actually belongs in same namespace
* Numerous documentation improvements

Known Issues:

* During repository mirroring, in order to fetch tags from a repository, at least
one tag in the list of tags to sync must exist exactly as specified. See
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/manage_red_hat_quay/index#repo-mirroring-in-red-hat-quay[Repository Mirroring in Red Hat Quay] for more details.
* Repository mirror config has known issues when remote registry username or password has characters requiring special handling for shell commands. Specifically, the tokens for registry.redhat.io with a pipe (|) character in them are incorrectly escaped. Out of an abundance of caution, a fix for this will follow in a subsequent update.
