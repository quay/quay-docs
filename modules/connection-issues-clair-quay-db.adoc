= Clair and Quay database connection issues 

When attempting to connect to an external PostgreSQL database for {productname} and Clair, attempting to connect to the "public" schema might not be allowed. The public schema is only accessible by PostgreSQL administrators. Use the following procedure to troubleshoot connection issues.

.Procedure 

. If you are an individual user accessing separate databases, use the following steps. 

.. Specify a `search_path`, for example, `\https://postgresqlco.nf/doc/en/param/search_path/` to the `Quay` and `Clair` database for the service account or user.

... Enter the following command on the `Quay` database:
+
[source,terminal]
----
ALTER ROLE "role_name" SET search_path TO quay_username;
----

.. Enter the following command on the `Clair` database:
+
[source,terminal]
----
ALTER ROLE "role_name" SET search_path TO clair_username;
----
+
[NOTE]
====
This will not allow one user to access the `Quay` and `Clair` database at the same time.
====

.. Optional. The `quay-app` pod requires the database to be created in advance to that the `quay-app-upgrade` pod assists in setting it up. As a result, schemas and tables are already populated. This causes an issue with the `search_path` setting for {productname}. To resolve this issue, add a `search_path` in your {productname} and Clair `config.yaml` files.

... Add the following line to your {productname} `config.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
DB_URI: postgresql://<user>:<pass>@quayhostname.example.com:<port>/quay_username?options=-csearch_path%3Dquay_username
----

... Reset the `Quay` database by cleaning it up and restarting the `quay-upgrade-app-pod`. 

... Configure the Clair connstring to use a `search_path` by adding the following line to your Clair `config.yaml` file:
+
[source,yamnl]
----
indexer:
connstring: host=<dbname> port=5402 dbname=db_name user=<clair_username> password=<pass> sslmode=disable options=--search_path=clair_username
----

. In some cases, you might have a single service account or be a user that can access both databases. A database contains one or more named schemas, which in turn contains tables. Unlike databases, schemas are not rigidly separated; that is, a user can access objects in any of the schemas in the database that they are connected to if they have proper privileges.
+
In this case, you must ensure that the tables of your {productname} and Clair are part of the same schema. Otherwise, unqualified queries are unable to find the tables. The queries from {productname} and Clair are all unqualified, as they expect the tables to be accessible from the database connection by default.
