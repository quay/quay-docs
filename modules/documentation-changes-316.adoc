The following documentation changes have been made with the {productname} 3.16 release:

* The link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_quay/3.15/html-single/deploying_the_red_hat_quay_operator_on_openshift_container_platform/index[Deploying {productname} on {ocp}] documentation has been refactored. This book is now organized as follows:

* Introduction to the {productname} Operator
* Installing the {productname} Operator from the OperatorHub
* Deploying the {productname} registry
* Creating the first user
* Modifying the QuayRegistry CR after deployment
* Enabling features after deployment
* Deploying {productname} on infrastructure nodes
* Advanced configuration
* Troubleshooting

This refactor streamlines the process of deploying a registry before introducing more advanced topics.
