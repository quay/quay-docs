= Registry state and system behavior configuration fields

The following configuration fields control the operational state of the {productname} registry and how it interacts with external systems. These settings allow administrators to place the registry into a restricted read-only mode for maintenance purposes, and to enforce additional security by blocking specific hostnames from being targeted by webhooks.
