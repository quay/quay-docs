* **Organizations** provide a way of sharing repositories under a common namespace that does not belong to a single user. Instead, these repositories belong to several users in a shared setting, such as a company.

* **Teams** provide a way for an Organization to delegate permissions. Permissions can be set at the global level (for example, across all repositories), or on specific repositories. They can also be set for specific sets, or groups, of users. 

* **Users** can log in to a registry through the web UI or a by using a client like Podman and using their respective login commands, for example, `$ podman login`. Each user automatically gets a user namespace, for example, `<quay-server.example.com>/<user>/<username>`, or `quay.io/<username>` if you are using {quayio}.

* **Superusers** have enhanced access and privileges through the *Super User Admin Panel* in the user interface. Superuser API calls are also available, which are not visible or accessible to normal users.

* **Robot accounts** provide automated access to repositories for non-human users like pipeline tools. Robot accounts are similar to {ocp} *Service Accounts*. Permissions can be granted to a robot account in a repository by adding that account like you would another user or team.
