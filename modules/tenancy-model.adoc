* **Organizations** provide a way of sharing repositories under a common namespace that does  not belong to a single user, but rather to many users in a shared setting (such as a company).
* **Teams** provide a way for an organization to delegate permissions (both global and on specific repositories) to sets or groups of users
* **Users** can log in to a registry through the Quay web UI or a client (such as `podman login`). Each users automatically gets a user namespace, for example,  `quay-server.example.com/user/<username>`
* **Super users** have enhanced access and privileges via the Super User Admin Panel in the user interface and through Super User API calls that are not visible or accessible to normal users
* **Robot accounts** provide automated access to repositories for non-human users such as pipeline tools and are similar in  nature to OpenShift service accounts. Permissions can be granted to a robot account in a repository by adding that account like any other user or team.
