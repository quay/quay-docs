= {productname} 3.10 known issues and limitations

The following sections note known issues and limitations for {productname} {producty}.

[id="known-issues-310"]
== {productname} 3.10 known issues

* There is a known issue with the auto-pruning feature when pushing image tags with Cosign signatures. In some scenarios, for example, when each image tag uses a different Cosign key, the auto-pruner worker removes the image signature and only keeps the image tag. This occurs because {productname} considers image tags and the signature as two tags. The expected behavior of this feature is that the auto-pruner should consider the image tag and signature as one item, calculate only the image tag, and when the auto-pruner worker is configured in such a way that the tag is pruned, it also prunes the signature. This will be fixed in a future version of {productname}. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-6380[*PROJQUAY-6380*])

* Currently, auditing for auto-pruning policy operations, including creating, updating, or deleting policies, is unavailable. This is a known issue and will be fixed in a future release of {productname}. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-6229[*PROJQUAY-6228*])

* Currently, the the auto-pruning worker prunes `ReadOnly` and mirror repositories, in addition to normal repositories. `ReadOnly` and mirror repositories should not be pruned automatically. This is a known issue and will be fixed in a future version of {productname}. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-6235[*PROJQUAY-6235*])

* When upgrading the {productname} Operator from versions 3.7, 3.8, or 3.9 to {producty}, users must manually remove the {productname} config editor by removing the `deployment`, `route,` `service`, and `secret` objects. For information about this procedure, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html-single/upgrade_red_hat_quay/index#config-editor-removal[Removing config editor objects on {productname} Operator].

* When creating a new team using the {productname} v2 UI, users are unable to add normal users to the new team while. This only occurs while setting up the new team. As a workaround, you can add users after the team has been created. Robot accounts are unaffected by this issue. This is a known issue and will be fixed in a future version of {productname}. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-6336[*PROJQUAY-6336*])

* Sometimes, when creating a new default permission setting, the *Create default permission* button is disabled. As a workaround, you can try adjusting the *Applied to* setting in the *Create default permission* wizard. This is a known issue and will be fixed in a future version of {productname}. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-6341[*PROJQUAY-6341*])
