= Working with tags

An _image tag_ refers to a label or identifier assigned to a specific version or variant of a container image. Container images are typically composed of multiple layers that represent different parts of the image. Image tags are used to differentiate between different versions of an image or to provide additional information about the image.

Image tags have the following benefits:

* *Versioning and Releases*: Image tags allow you to denote different versions or releases of an application or software. For example, you might have an image tagged as _v1.0_ to represent the initial release and _v1.1_ for an updated version. This helps in maintaining a clear record of image versions.

* *Rollbacks and Testing*: If you encounter issues with a new image version, you can easily revert to a previous version by specifying its tag. This is particularly helpful during debugging and testing phases.

* *Development Environments*: Image tags are beneficial when working with different environments. You might use a _dev_ tag for a development version, _qa_ for quality assurance testing, and _prod_ for production, each with their respective features and configurations.

* *Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)*: CI/CD pipelines often utilize image tags to automate the deployment process. New code changes can trigger the creation of a new image with a specific tag, enabling seamless updates.

* *Feature Branches*: When multiple developers are working on different features or bug fixes, they can create distinct image tags for their changes. This helps in isolating and testing individual features.

* *Customization*: You can use image tags to customize images with different configurations, dependencies, or optimizations, while keeping track of each variant.

* *Security and Patching*: When security vulnerabilities are discovered, you can create patched versions of images with updated tags, ensuring that your systems are using the latest secure versions.

* *Dockerfile Changes*: If you modify the Dockerfile or build process, you can use image tags to differentiate between images built from the previous and updated Dockerfiles.

Overall, image tags provide a structured way to manage and organize container images, enabling efficient development, deployment, and maintenance workflows.

[id="deleting-a-tag"]
=== Deleting an image tag

Deleting an image tag effectively removes that specific version of the image from the registry. Users might delete image tags for the following reasons:

* *Security Vulnerabilities*: If a specific image tag is found to contain security vulnerabilities or issues, it's recommended to delete that tag to prevent its accidental use. This ensures that users will not inadvertently deploy containers with known security flaws.


* *Version Cleanup*: Over time, as you release newer versions of an application, older tags might become obsolete. Deleting older tags can help keep your registry organized and prevent confusion among users about which version to use.

* *Storage Management*: Container images can consume significant storage space, especially if you have multiple versions with different tags. Deleting unused or outdated tags helps free up storage resources in the registry.

* *Misconfigured or Deprecated Tags*: Sometimes, tags might be misconfigured or deprecated. For example, if a tag was accidentally created with incorrect content, you might want to delete it to avoid confusion.

* *Releases and Rollbacks*: When you've released a newer version of an image and verified its stability, you might decide to delete tags corresponding to older, less stable versions.

* *Regulatory Compliance*: Depending on your industry or regulatory requirements, you might have policies that dictate the retention and deletion of certain image versions.

* *Tag Mistakes*: Mistakes can happen, and you might accidentally create a tag with incorrect content or naming conventions. Deleting such tags helps maintain consistency and accuracy in your image repository.

* *Namespace Cleanup*: If you're using a shared registry with multiple teams or projects, you might want to periodically clean up old tags to avoid clutter and confusion.

* *Versioning Cleanup*: If you use tags for versioning, like "v1," "v2," etc., you might want to delete older versions that are no longer relevant.

* *Optimize Pulls*: By having fewer tags, users can quickly identify and pull the correct version without having to sift through many outdated options.

To delete an image tag, use the following procedure.

.Procedure 

. Navigate to the *Tags* page of a repository. 

. Click *Delete Tag*. This deletes the tag and any images unique to it. 
+
[NOTE]
====
Deleting an image tag can be reverted based on the amount of time allotted assigned to the _time machine_ feature. For more information, see "Reverting tag changes".

[id="tag-expiration"]
== Tag Expiration

Image can be set to expire from a
ifeval::["{context}" == "quay-io"]
{quayio}
endif::[]
ifeval::["{context}" ==! "use-quay"]
{productname}
endif::[]
repository at a chosen date and time using the _tag expiration_ feature. This feature includes the following characteristics: 

* When an image tag expires, it is deleted from the repository. If it is the last tag for a specific image, the image is also set to be deleted. 

* Expiration is set on a per-tag basis. It is not set for a repository as a whole. 

* After a tag is expired or deleted, it is not immediately removed from the registry. This is contingent upon the allotted time designed in the _time machine_ feature, which defines when the tag is permanently deleted, or garbage collected. By default, this value is set at _14 days_, however the administrator can adjust this time to one of multiple variables. Up until the point that garbage collection occurs, tags changes can be reverted. 

ifeval::["{context}" ==! "use-quay"]
The {productname} superuser has no special privilege related to deleting expired images from user repositories. There is no central mechanism for the superuser to gather information and act on user repositories. It is up to the owners of each repository to manage expiration and the deletion of their images. 
endif::[]

Tag expiration can be set up in one of two ways: 

* By setting the `quay.expires-after=` LABEL in the Dockerfile when the image is created. This sets a time to expire from when the image is built.

* By selecting an expiration date on the
ifeval::["{context}" == "quay-io"]
{quayio}
endif::[]
ifeval::["{context}" ==! "use-quay"]
{productname}
endif::[]
UI. For example:
+
image:tag-expires-ui.png[Change tag expiration under the Options icon or from the EXPIRES column]

[id="setting-tag-from-dockerfile"]
=== Setting tag expiration from a Dockerfile

Adding a label, for example, `quay.expires-after=20h` by using the `docker label` command causes a tag to automatically expire after the time indicated. The following values for hours, days, or weeks are accepted:

* `1h`
* `2d`
* `3w`

Expiration begins from the time that the image is built. 

[id="setting-tag-expiration"]
=== Setting tag expiration from the repository

Tag expiration can be set on the 
ifeval::["{context}" == "quay-io"]

endif::[]
UI.

.Procedure 

. Navigate to a repository and click *Tags* in the navigation pane. 

. Click the *Settings*, or _gear_ icon, for an image tag and select *Change Expiration*. 

. Select the date and time when prompted, and select *Change Expiration*. The tag is set to be deleted from the repository when the expiration time is reached.
