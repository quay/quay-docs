= Working with tags

Tags provide a way to identify the version of an image, as well as
offering a means of naming the same image in different ways.
Besides an image's version, an image tag can identify its uses (such as devel,
testing, or prod) or the fact that it is the most recent version (latest).

From the `Tags` tab of an image repository, you can view, modify, add, move, delete, and
see the history of tags. You also can fetch command-lines you can use to
download (pull) a specific image (based on its name and tag) using different commands.

[[viewing-and-modifying-tags]]
== Viewing and modifying tags

The tags of a repository can be viewed and modified in the tags panel of
the repository page, found by clicking on the `Tags` tab.

[[adding-a-new-tag-to-a-tagged-image]]
=== Adding a new tag to a tagged image

A new tag can be added to a tagged image by clicking on the gear icon next to
the tag and choosing `Add New Tag`. Quay.io will confirm the addition of
the new tag to the image.

[[moving-a-tag]]
=== Moving a tag

Moving a tag to a different image is accomplished by performing the same
operation as adding a new tag, but giving an existing tag name. Quay.io
will confirm that you want the tag moved, rather than added.

[[deleting-a-tag]]
=== Deleting a tag

A specific tag and all its images can be deleted by clicking on the tag's gear icon
and choosing `Delete Tag`. This will delete the tag and any images unique
to it. Images will not be deleted until no tag references them either
directly or indirectly through a parent child relationship.

[[viewing-tag-history-and-going-back-in-time]]
=== Viewing tag history and going back in time

[[viewing-tag-history]]
==== Viewing tag history

To view the image history for a tag, click on the `View Tags History` menu
item located under the `Actions` menu. The page shown will display each
image to which the tag pointed in the past and when it pointed to that
image.

[[going-back-in-time]]
==== Going back in time

To revert the tag to a previous image, find the history line where your
desired image was overwritten, and click on the Restore link.

[[fetching-images-and-tags]]
=== Fetching an image by tag or digest
From the `Tags` tab, you can view different ways of pulling images from the clients
that are ready to use those images.

. Select a particular repository/image
. Select Tags in the left column
. Select the Fetch Tag icon for a particular image/tag combination
. When the Fetch Tag pop-up appears, select the Image format box to
see a drop-down menu that shows different ways that are
available to pull the image. The selections offer full command lines
for pulling a specific container image to the local system:

image:image-fetch.png[Get commands for fetching images in different ways]

You can select to pull a regular of an image by tag name or by digest name using the *docker* command.
You can pull a squashed version of the image with *docker* by selecting `Squashed Docker Image`.
There is also an example for pulling the image using the `rkt` command.
. Choose the type of pull you want, then select `Copy Command`.
The full command-line is copied into your clipboard.
These two commands show a *docker pull* by tag and by digest:

```
docker pull quay.io/cnegus/whatever:latest
docker pull quay.io/cnegus/whatever@sha256:e02231a6aa8ba7f5da3859a359f99d77e371cb47e643ce78e101958782581fb9
```

Paste the command into a command-line shell on a system that has the
*docker* command and service available, and press Enter.
At this point, the container image is ready to run on your local system.

On RHEL and Fedora systems, you can
substitute *podman* for *docker* to pull and run the selected image.

[[security-scanning]]
== Security scanning

By clicking the on the vulnerability or fixable count next to a tab you
can jump into the security scanning information for that tag. There you
can find which CVEs your image is susceptible to, and what remediation
options you may have available.
