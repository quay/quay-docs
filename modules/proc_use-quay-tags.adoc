= Working with tags

Tags provide a way to identify the version of an image, as well as
offering a means of naming the same image in different ways.
Besides an image's version, an image tag can identify its uses (such as devel,
testing, or prod) or the fact that it is the most recent version (latest).

From the `Tags` tab of an image repository, you can view, modify, add, move, delete, and
see the history of tags. You also can fetch command-lines you can use to
download (pull) a specific image (based on its name and tag) using different commands.

[[viewing-and-modifying-tags]]
== Viewing and modifying tags

The tags of a repository can be viewed and modified in the tags panel of
the repository page, found by clicking on the `Tags` tab.

[[adding-a-new-tag-to-a-tagged-image]]
=== Adding a new tag to a tagged image

A new tag can be added to a tagged image by clicking on the gear icon next to
the tag and choosing `Add New Tag`. {productname} will confirm the addition of
the new tag to the image.

[[moving-a-tag]]
=== Moving a tag

Moving a tag to a different image is accomplished by performing the same
operation as adding a new tag, but giving an existing tag name. {productname}
will confirm that you want the tag moved, rather than added.

[[deleting-a-tag]]
=== Deleting a tag

A specific tag and all its images can be deleted by clicking on the tag's gear icon
and choosing `Delete Tag`. This will delete the tag and any images unique
to it. Images will not be deleted until no tag references them either
directly or indirectly through a parent child relationship.

[[viewing-tag-history-and-going-back-in-time]]
=== Viewing tag history and going back in time

[[viewing-tag-history]]
==== Viewing tag history

To view the image history for a tag, click on the `View Tags History` menu
item located under the `Actions` menu. The page shown will display each
image to which the tag pointed in the past and when it pointed to that
image.

[[going-back-in-time]]
==== Going back in time

To revert the tag to a previous image, find the history line where your
desired image was overwritten, and click on the Restore link.

[[fetching-images-and-tags]]
=== Fetching an image by tag or digest
From the `Tags` tab, you can view different ways of pulling images from the clients
that are ready to use those images.

. Select a particular repository/image
. Select Tags in the left column
. Select the Fetch Tag icon for a particular image/tag combination
. When the Fetch Tag pop-up appears, select the Image format box to
see a drop-down menu that shows different ways that are
available to pull the image. The selections offer full command lines
for pulling a specific container image to the local system:

image:image-fetch.png[Get commands for fetching images in different ways]

You can select to pull a regular of an image by tag name or by digest name using the *docker* command.
. Choose the type of pull you want, then select `Copy Command`.
The full command-line is copied into your clipboard.
These two commands show a *docker pull* by tag and by digest:

```
docker pull quay.io/cnegus/whatever:latest
docker pull quay.io/cnegus/whatever@sha256:e02231a6aa8ba7f5da3859a359f99d77e371cb47e643ce78e101958782581fb9
```

Paste the command into a command-line shell on a system that has the
*docker* command and service available, and press Enter.
At this point, the container image is ready to run on your local system.

On RHEL and Fedora systems, you can
substitute *podman* for *docker* to pull and run the selected image.

[[tag-expiration]]
== Tag Expiration

Images can be set to expire from a {productname} repository at a chosen date and time using a feature called `tag expiration`.
Here are a few things to know about about tag expiration:

* When a tag expires, the tag is deleted from the repository. If it is the last tag for a specific image, the image is set to be deleted.

* Expiration is set on a per-tag basis, not for a repository on the whole.

* When a tag expires or is deleted, it is not immediately removed from the registry.
The value of Time Machine (in User settings) defines when the deleted tag is actually removed
and garbage collected. By default, that value is 14 days. Up until that time, a tag can be repointed to an expired or deleted image.

* The {productname} superuser has no special privilege related to deleting expired images from user repositories.
There is no central mechanism for the superuser to gather information and act on user repositories.
It is up to the owners of each repository to manage expiration and ultimate deletion of their images.

Tag expiration can be set in different ways:

* By setting the `quay.expires-after=` LABEL in the Dockerfile when the image is created.
This sets a time to expire from when the image is built.

* By choosing the expiration date from the EXPIRES column for the repository tag and selecting a specific date and time to expire.

The following figure shows the Options entry for changing tag expiration and the EXPIRES field for when the tag expires.
Hover over the EXPIRES field to see the expiration date and time that is currently set.

image:tag-expires-ui.png[Change tag expiration under the Options icon or from the EXPIRES column]

=== Setting tag expiration from a Dockerfile

Adding a label like `quay.expires-after=20h` via the Dockerfile LABEL command will cause a tag to automatically expire
after the time indicated.
The time values could be something like `1h`, `2d`, `3w` for hours, days, and weeks, respectively, from the time the image is built.

=== Setting tag expiration from the repository

On the Repository Tag page there is a UI column titled *EXPIRES* that indicates when a tag will expire.
Users can set this by clicking on the time that it will expire or by clicking the Settings button (gear icon) on the right and choosing `Change Expiration`.

Choose the date and time when prompted and select `Change Expiration`.
The tag will be set to be deleted from the repository when the expiration time is reached.

[[security-scanning]]
== Security scanning

By clicking the on the vulnerability or fixable count next to a tab you
can jump into the security scanning information for that tag. There you
can find which CVEs your image is susceptible to, and what remediation
options you may have available.

Keep in mind that image scanning only lists vulnerabilities found by the Clair image scanner.
What each user does about the vulnerabilities that are uncovered is completely up to that user.
The {productname} superuser does not act on those vulnerabilities found.
