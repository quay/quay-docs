By default, {productname} deployments include managed *Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPAs)* for key components to ensure availability and performance during load spikes or maintenance events. HPAs automatically adjust the number of running pods based on observed CPU and memory utilization.

A typical {productname} deployment includes the following pods:
