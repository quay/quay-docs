= Configuring SSL/TLS and routes

[role="_abstract"]
Support for {ocp} _edge termination_ routes is provided through the `tls` component. This separation allows independent control of route management and TLS certificate handling.

`EXTERNAL_TLS_TERMINATION: true` is the default, opinionated setting, which assumes the cluster manages TLS termination.

[NOTE]
====
* When `tls` is *managed*, the cluster's default wildcard certificate is used.
* When `tls` is *unmanaged*, you must supply your own SSL/TLS certificate and key pair.
====

Multiple valid configurations are possible, as shown in the following table:

|Option | Route | TLS | Certs provided | Result
| My own load balancer handles TLS | Managed | Managed | No | Edge route using default cluster wildcard certificate
| {productname} handles TLS | Managed | Unmanaged | Yes | Passthrough route with certificates mounted in the {productname} pod
| {productname} handles TLS | Unmanaged | Unmanaged | Yes | Certificates set inside the {productname} pod; user must manually create a route
