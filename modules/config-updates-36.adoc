= Configuration updates for Quay 3.6

== New configuration fields

* **FEATURE_EXTENDED_REPOSITORY_NAMES:** Support for nested repositories and extended repository names has been added. This change allows the use of `/` in repository names needed for certain OpenShift Container Platform use cases. For more information, see xref:config-fields-nested-repositories[Configuring nested repositories]

* **FEATURE_USER_INITIALIZE:** If set to true, the first User account may be created via API `/api/v1/user/initialize`. For more information, see xref:config-preconfigure-automation[Pre-configuring Quay for automation]


* **ALLOWED_OCI_ARTIFACT_TYPES:**  Helm, cosign, and ztsd compression scheme artifacts are built into {productname} 3.6 by default. For any other OCI media type that is not supported by default, you can add them to the `ALLOWED_OCI_ARTIFACT_TYPES` configuration in Quay's `config.yaml` For more information, see xref:other-oci-artifacts-with-quay[Adding other OCI media types to Quay]



* **CREATE_PRIVATE_REPO_ON_PUSH:** Registry users now have the option to set `CREATE_PRIVATE_REPO_ON_PUSH` in their config.yaml to `True` or `False` depending on their security needs.

* **CREATE_NAMESPACE_ON_PUSH:** Pushing to a non-existent organization can now be configured to automatically create the organization.




== Deprecated configuration fields

* *FEATURE_HELM_OCI_SUPPORT*: This option has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version of {productname}. In {productname} 3.6, Helm artifacts are supported by default and included under the `FEATURE_GENERAL_OCI_SUPPORT` property. Users are no longer required to update their config.yaml files to enable support.
