= Unmanaged Clair configuration

{productname} users can run an unmanaged Clair configuration with the {productname} {ocp} Operator. This feature allows users to create an unmanaged Clair database, or run their custom Clair configuration without an unmanaged database.

An unmanaged Clair database allows the {productname} Operator to work in a geo-replicated environment, where multiple instances of the Operator must communicate with the same database. An unmanaged Clair database can also be used when a user requires a highly-available (HA) Clair database that exists outside of a cluster.
