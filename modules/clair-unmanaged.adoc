= Unmanaged Clair configuration

[role="_abstract"]
Unmanaged Clair configuration lets you run a custom Clair setup or use an external Clair database with the {productname} Operator. You can use this configuration for geo-replicated environments where multiple Operator instances share the same database, or when you need a highly available database outside your cluster.
