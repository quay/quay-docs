= Configuring {productname}

Before running the {productname} service as a container, you need to use that same quay container
to create the configuration file (`config.yaml`) needed to deploy {productname}.
To do that, you pass a `config` argument and a password (replace my-secret-password here)
to the quay container.
Later, you use that password to log into the configuration tool as the user `quayconfig`.

Here's an example of how to do that:

. **Start quay in config mode**: On the first quay node, run the following:
+
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
....
# docker run --privileged=true -p 8443:8443 -d quay.io/redhat/quay:v{productmin} config my-secret-password
....

. **Open browser**: When the quay configuration tool starts up, open a browser to the URL and port 8443
of the system you are running the configuration tool on
(for example https://myquay.example.com:8443). You are prompted for a username and password.

. **Log in as quayconfig**: When prompted, enter the `quayconfig` username and password
(the one from the `docker run` command line).

. **Choose configuration mode**: You are prompted to choose to either create a new
{productname} configuration file or edit an existing one in these two modes:

* **Start New Registry Setup**: The result of this selection is the creation of a new
configuration file (`config.yaml`) and optional `ssl.cert` and `ssl.key` files.
Those files are bundled into a tarball file you can use to
actually deploy all your {productname} nodes.

* **Modify an existing configuration**: With this selection, you are prompted
to provide an existing tarball and
modify it before you use it to start your {productname} nodes.
+
The following figure shows an example of the resulting `Choose an option` page:
+

+
For an initial setup, you are asked to identify the database type.
For a subsequent configuration, you are prompted for a tarball containing the
`config.yaml` and credential files (optional). Then you
can continue on with the configuration.

. **Identify the database**: For the initial setup, add the following information about the type and location of the database to be used by {productname}:
+
* **Database Type**: Choose MySQL or PostgreSQL. MySQL will be used in the basic example; PostgreSQL is used with the
high availability {productname} on OpenShift examples.
+
* **Database Server**: Identify the IP address or hostname of the database,
along with the port number if it is different from 3306.
+
* **Username**: Identify a user with full access to the database.
+
* **Password**: Enter the password you assigned to the selected user.
+
* **Database Name**: Enter the database name you assigned when you started the database server.
+
* **SSL Certificate**: For production environments, you should provide an SSL certificate to connect to the database.
+
The following figure shows an example of the screen for identifying the database used by {productname}:
+

+
. **Validate database**: Select `Validate Database Settings`, and proceed to the next screen.

. **Create {productname} superuser**: You need to set up an account with superuser privileges to {productname}, to use for editing {productname} configuration settings. That information includes a Username, Email address, and Password (entered twice).
+
The following figure shows an example of the {productname} Setup screen for setting up a {productname} superuser account:
+

+
Select `Create Super User`, and proceed to the next screen.

. **Identify the Redis hostname, Server Configuration and add other desired settings**: Other setting you can add to complete the setup are as follows. More settings for high availability {productname} deployment that for the basic deployment:

+
* For the basic, test configuration, identifying the Redis Hostname should be all you need to do.
However, you can add other features, such as Clair Scanning and Repository Mirroring,
as described at the end of this procedure.
+
* For the high availability and OpenShift configurations, more settings are needed (as noted below) to allow for shared storage, secure communications between systems, and other features.
+
**Here are the settings you need to consider:**
+
* **Custom SSL Certificates**: Upload custom or self-signed SSL certificates for use by {productname}. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html-single/manage_red_hat_quay/index#using-ssl-to-protect-quay[Using SSL to protect connections to {productname}] for details. Recommended for high availability.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Using SSL certificates is recommended for both basic
and high availability deployments. If you decide to
not use SSL, you must configure your container clients
to use your new {productname} setup as an insecure registry
as described in link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/insecure/[Test an Insecure Registry].
====

* **Basic Configuration**: Upload a company logo to rebrand your {productname} registry.
* **Server Configuration**: Hostname or IP address to reach the {productname} service, along with TLS indication (recommended for production installations). The Server Hostname is required for all {productname} deployments.
TLS termination can be done in two different ways:
- On the instance itself, with all TLS traffic governed by the nginx server in the quay container (recommended).
- On the load balancer. This is not recommended. Access to {productname} could be lost if the TLS setup is not done correctly on the load balancer.

* **Data Consistency Settings**: Select to relax logging consistency guarantees to improve performance and availability.
* **Time Machine**: Allow older image tags to remain in the repository for set periods of time and allow users to select their own tag expiration times.
* **redis**: Identify the hostname or IP address (and optional password) to connect to the redis service used by {productname}.
* **Repository Mirroring**: Choose the checkbox to Enable Repository Mirroring.
With this enabled, you can create repositories in your {productname} cluster that mirror
selected repositories from remote registries. Before you can enable repository mirroring,
start the repository mirroring worker as described later in this procedure.
* **Registry Storage**: Identify the location of storage. A variety of cloud and local storage options are available. Remote storage is required for high availability. Identify the Ceph storage location
if you are following the example for {productname} high availability storage. On OpenShift, the example uses Amazon S3 storage.
* **Action Log Rotation and Archiving**: Select to enable log rotation, which moves logs older than 30 days into storage, then indicate storage area.
* **Security Scanner**: Enable security scanning by selecting a security scanner endpoint and authentication key. To setup Clair to do image scanning, refer to link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html-single/manage_red_hat_quay/#clair-initial-setup[Clair Setup] and link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html-single/manage_red_hat_quay/#configuring-clair-for-tls[Configuring Clair]. Recommended for high availability.
* **Application Registry**: Enable an additional application registry that includes things like Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts (see the link:https://github.com/app-registry[App Registry specification]).
* **BitTorrent-based download**: Allow all registry images to be downloaded using BitTorrent protocol (using the link:https://github.com/coreos/quayctl[`quayctl`] tool).
* **rkt Conversion**: Allow `rkt fetch` to be used to fetch images from {productname} registry. Public and private GPG2 keys are needed (see link:https://coreos.com/quay-enterprise/docs/latest/aci-signing-keys.html[Generating signing keys for ACI conversion] for details.
This field is deprecated.
* **E-mail**: Enable e-mail to use for notifications and user password resets.
* **Internal Authentication**: Change default authentication for the registry from Local Database to LDAP, Keystone (OpenStack), JWT Custom Authentication, or External Application Token.
* **External Authorization (OAuth)**: Enable to allow GitHub or GitHub Enterprise to authenticate to the registry.
* **Google Authentication**: Enable to allow Google to authenticate to the registry.
* **Access Settings**: Basic username/password authentication is enabled by default. Other authentication types that can be enabled include: external application tokens (user-generated tokens used with docker or rkt commands), anonymous access (enable for public access to anyone who can get to the registry), user creation (let users create their own accounts), encrypted client password (require command-line user access to include encrypted passwords), and prefix username autocompletion (disable to require exact username matches on autocompletion).
* **Registry Protocol Settings**: Leave the `Restrict V1 Push Support` checkbox enabled
to restrict access to Docker V1 protocol pushes.
Although Red Hat recommends against enabling Docker V1 push protocol, if you do allow it,
you must explicitly whitelist the namespaces for which it is enabled.
* **Dockerfile Build Support**: Enable to allow users to submit Dockerfiles to be built and pushed to {productname}.
This is not recommended for multitenant environments.

. **Save the changes**: Select `Save Configuration Changes`. You are presented with the following Download Configuration screen:
+
image:Figure04.png[Download the {productname} configuration tarball to the local system]
. **Download configuration**: Select the `Download Configuration` button and save the
tarball (`quay-config.tar.gz`) to a local directory to use later to start {productname}.

At this point, you can shutdown the {productname} configuration tool and close your browser. Next, copy the tarball file to the system
on which you want to install your first {productname} node. For a basic install, you might just be running
{productname} on the same system.
