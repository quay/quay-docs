= Base image pull in Dockerfile fails with HTTP error 403

In some cases, you might receive an HTTP error `403` when attempting to use a private base image as the `FROM` line in a Build Trigger. To use a private base image as the `FROM` lin in a Build Trigger, credentials for your robot account with _read access to the private image_ must be specified when setting up the Build Trigger. 

For more information about robot accounts and Build Triggers, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/use_red_hat_quay/index#github-build-triggers[Setting up Github Build Trigger tags].
