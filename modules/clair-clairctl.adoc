= Setting up Clair in a disconnected {ocp} cluster

[role="_abstract"]
To install the `clairctl` command line utility for disconnected {ocp} deployments, you can extract the tool from a running Clair pod and set its execution permissions. This lets you use `clairctl` to manage vulnerability database updates in disconnected environments.

.Procedure

. Install the `clairctl` program for a Clair deployment in an {ocp} cluster by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n quay-enterprise exec example-registry-clair-app-64dd48f866-6ptgw -- cat /usr/bin/clairctl > clairctl
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Unofficially, the `clairctl` tool can be downloaded
====

. Set the permissions of the `clairctl` file so that it can be executed and run by the user, for example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ chmod u+x ./clairctl
----
