= Image tags overview

An _image tag_ refers to a label or identifier assigned to a specific version or variant of a container image. Container images are typically composed of multiple layers that represent different parts of the image. Image tags are used to differentiate between different versions of an image or to provide additional information about the image.

Image tags have the following benefits:

* *Versioning and Releases*: Image tags allow you to denote different versions or releases of an application or software. For example, you might have an image tagged as _v1.0_ to represent the initial release and _v1.1_ for an updated version. This helps in maintaining a clear record of image versions.

* *Rollbacks and Testing*: If you encounter issues with a new image version, you can easily revert to a previous version by specifying its tag. This is helpful during debugging and testing phases.

* *Development Environments*: Image tags are beneficial when working with different environments. You might use a _dev_ tag for a development version, _qa_ for quality assurance testing, and _prod_ for production, each with their respective features and configurations.

* *Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)*: CI/CD pipelines often utilize image tags to automate the deployment process. New code changes can trigger the creation of a new image with a specific tag, enabling seamless updates.

* *Feature Branches*: When multiple developers are working on different features or bug fixes, they can create distinct image tags for their changes. This helps in isolating and testing individual features.

* *Customization*: You can use image tags to customize images with different configurations, dependencies, or optimizations, while keeping track of each variant.

* *Security and Patching*: When security vulnerabilities are discovered, you can create patched versions of images with updated tags, ensuring that your systems are using the latest secure versions.

* *Dockerfile Changes*: If you modify the Dockerfile or build process, you can use image tags to differentiate between images built from the previous and updated Dockerfiles.

Overall, image tags provide a structured way to manage and organize container images, enabling efficient development, deployment, and maintenance workflows.
