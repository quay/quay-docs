= {productname} build limitations

Running builds in {productname} in an unprivileged context might cause some commands that were working under the previous build strategy to fail. Attempts to change the build strategy could potentially cause performance issues and reliability with the build.

Running builds directly in a container does not have the same isolation as using virtual machines. Changing the build environment might also caused builds that were previously working to fail.
