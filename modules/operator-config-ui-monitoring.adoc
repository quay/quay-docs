= Monitoring reconfiguration in the UI


== QuayRegistry resource

After reconfiguring the Operator, you can track the progress of the re-deployment in the YAML tab for the specific instance of QuayRegistry, in this case, `example-registry`:

Each time the status changes, you will be prompted to reload the data to see the updated version. Eventually, the Operator will reconcile the changes, and there will be no unhealthy components reported.
