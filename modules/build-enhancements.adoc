= {productname} build enhancements

Prior to {productname} 3.7, Quay ran `podman` commands in virtual machines launched by pods. Running builds on virtual platforms requires enabling nested virtualization, which is not featured in Red Hat Enterprise Linux or OpenShift Container Platform. As a result, builds had to run on bare-metal clusters, which is an inefficient use of resources.

With {productname} 3.7., the bare-metal constraint required to run builds has been removed by adding an additional build option which does not contain the virtual machine layer. As a result, builds can be run on virtualized platforms. Backwards compatibility to run previous build configurations are also available.
