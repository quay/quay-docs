= OCI and Helm configuration

Support for Helm and OCI artifacts is now enabled by default in {productname} {producty}. If you need to explicitly enable the feature, for example, if it has previously been disabled or if you have upgraded from a version where it is not enabled by default, you need to add two properties in the Quay configuration to enable the use of OCI artifacts:

[source,yaml]
----
FEATURE_GENERAL_OCI_SUPPORT: true
FEATURE_HELM_OCI_SUPPORT: true
----
