= Configuring OIDC for {productname}

Configuring OpenID Connect (OIDC) for {productname} can provide several benefits to your deployment. For example, OIDC allows users to authenticate to {productname} using their existing credentials from an OIDC provider, such as link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_single_sign-on/7.0[Red Hat Single Sign-On], Google, Github, Microsoft, or others. Other benefits of OIDC include centralized user management, enhanced security, and single sign-on (SSO). Overall, OIDC configuration can simplify user authentication and management, enhance security, and provide a seamless user experience for {productname} users.

The following procedures show you how to configure Microsoft Entra ID on a standalone deployment of {productname}, and how to configure Red Hat Single Sign-On on an Operator-based deployment of {productname}. These procedures are interchangeable depending on your deployment type.

[NOTE]
====
By following these procedures, you will be able to add any OIDC provider to {productname}, regardless of which identity provider you choose to use.

== Configuring Microsoft Entra ID OIDC on a standalone deployment of {productname}

By integrating Microsoft Entra ID authentication with {productname}, your organization can take advantage of the centralized user management and security features offered by Microsoft Entra ID. Some features include the ability to manage user access to {productname} repositories based on their Microsoft Entra ID roles and permissions, and the ability to enable multi-factor authentication and other security features provided by Microsoft Entra ID.

Azure Active Directory (Microsoft Entra ID) authentication for {productname} allows users to authenticate and access {productname} using their Microsoft Entra ID credentials.

Use the following procedure to configure Microsoft Entra ID by updating the {productname} `config.yaml` file directly.

.Procedure

[NOTE]
====
* Using the following procedure, you can add any ODIC provider to {productname}, regardless of which identity provider is being added.
* If your system has a firewall in use, or proxy enabled, you must whitelist all Azure API endpoints for each Oauth application that is created. Otherwise, the following error is returned: `x509: certificate signed by unknown authority`.
====

. Use the following reference and update your `config.yaml` file with your desired OIDC provider's credentials:
+
[source,yaml]
----
AUTHENTICATION_TYPE: OIDC
# ...
AZURE_LOGIN_CONFIG: <1>
    CLIENT_ID: <client_id> <2>
    CLIENT_SECRET: <client_secret> <3>
    OIDC_SERVER: <oidc_server_address_> <4>
    SERVICE_NAME: Microsoft Entra ID <5>
    VERIFIED_EMAIL_CLAIM_NAME: <verified_email> <6>
# ...
----
<1> The parent key that holds the OIDC configuration settings. In this example, the parent key used is `AZURE_LOGIN_CONFIG`, however, the string `AZURE` can be replaced with any arbitrary string based on your specific needs, for example `ABC123`.However, the following strings are not accepted: `GOOGLE`, `GITHUB`. These strings are reserved for their respective identity platforms and require a specific `config.yaml` entry contingent upon when platform you are using.
<2> The client ID of the application that is being registered with the identity provider. 
<3> The client secret of the application that is being registered with the identity provider.
<4> The address of the OIDC server that is being used for authentication. In this example, you must use `sts.windows.net` as the issuer identifier. Using `https://login.microsoftonline.com` results in the following error: `Could not create provider for AzureAD. Error: oidc: issuer did not match the issuer returned by provider, expected "https://login.microsoftonline.com/73f2e714-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-dffe1df8a5d5" got "https://sts.windows.net/73f2e714-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-dffe1df8a5d5/"`. 
<5> The name of the service that is being authenticated.
<6> The name of the claim that is used to verify the email address of the user.

. Proper configuration of Microsoft Entra ID results three redirects with the following format:
+
* `\https://QUAY_HOSTNAME/oauth2/<name_of_service>/callback`
* `\https://QUAY_HOSTNAME/oauth2/<name_of_service>/callback/attach`
* `\https://QUAY_HOSTNAME/oauth2/<name_of_service>/callback/cli`

. Restart your {productname} deployment.
