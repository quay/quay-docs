= Upgrade Quay Bridge Operator

To upgrade the Quay Bridge Operator (QBO), change the Channel Subscription update channel in the Subscription tab to the desired channel.

When upgrading QBO from version 3.5 to 3.7, a number of extra steps are required:

. You need to create a new `QuayIntegration` custom resource. This can be completed in the Web Console or from the command line.
