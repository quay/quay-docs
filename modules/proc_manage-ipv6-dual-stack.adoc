= IPv6 and dual-stack deployments

Your standalone {productname} deployment can now be served in locations that only support IPv6, such as Telco and Edge environments. Support is also offered for dual-stack networking so your {productname} deployment can listen on IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously.

For a list of known limitations, see xref:proc_manage-ipv6-limitations-38[IPv6 limitations]

== Enabling the IPv6 protocol family

Use the following procedure to enable IPv6 support on your standalone {productname} deployment. 

.Prerequisites 

* You have updated {productname} to 3.8.
* Your host and container software platform (Docker, Podman) must be configured to support IPv6. 

.Procedure 

. In your deployment's `config.yaml` file, add the `FEATURE_LISTEN_IP_VERSION` parameter and set it to `IPv6`, for example: 
+
[source,yaml]
----
---
FEATURE_GOOGLE_LOGIN: false
FEATURE_INVITE_ONLY_USER_CREATION: false
FEATURE_LISTEN_IP_VERSION: IPv6
FEATURE_MAILING: false
FEATURE_NONSUPERUSER_TEAM_SYNCING_SETUP: false
---
----

. Start, or restart, your {productname} deployment. 

. Check that your deployment is listening to IPv6. 
+
.. For a standalone deployment, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl <quay_endpoint>/health/instance
{"data":{"services":{"auth":true,"database":true,"disk_space":true,"registry_gunicorn":true,"service_key":true,"web_gunicorn":true}},"status_code":200}
----

After enabling IPv6 in your deployment's `config.yaml`, all {productname} features can be used as normal, so long as your environment is configured to use IPv6 and is not hindered by the ipv6-limitations[current limitations]. 

[WARNING]
====
If your environment is configured to IPv4, but the `FEATURE_LISTEN_IP_VERSION` configuration field is set to `IPv6`, {productname} will fail to deploy.

== Enabling the dual-stack protocol family

Use the following procedure to enable dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6) support on your standalone {productname} deployment. 


.Prerequisites 

* You have updated {productname} to 3.8.
* Your host and container software platform (Docker, Podman) must be configured to support IPv6. 

.Procedure

. In your deployment's `config.yaml` file, add the `FEATURE_LISTEN_IP_VERSION` parameter and set it to `dual-stack`, for example: 
+
[source,yaml]
----
---
FEATURE_GOOGLE_LOGIN: false
FEATURE_INVITE_ONLY_USER_CREATION: false
FEATURE_LISTEN_IP_VERSION: dual-stack
FEATURE_MAILING: false
FEATURE_NONSUPERUSER_TEAM_SYNCING_SETUP: false
---
----

. Start, or restart, your {productname} deployment. 

. Check that your deployment is listening to both channels by entering the following command:
.. For IPv4, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl --ipv4 <quay_endpoint>
{"data":{"services":{"auth":true,"database":true,"disk_space":true,"registry_gunicorn":true,"service_key":true,"web_gunicorn":true}},"status_code":200}
----
.. For IPv6, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl --ipv6 <quay_endpoint> 
{"data":{"services":{"auth":true,"database":true,"disk_space":true,"registry_gunicorn":true,"service_key":true,"web_gunicorn":true}},"status_code":200}
----

After enabling dual-stack in your deployment's `config.yaml`, all {productname} features can be used as normal, so long as your environment is configured for dual-stack.

== IPv6 limitations: 

* Currently, attempting to configure your {productname} deployment with the common Azure Blob Storage configuration will not work on IPv6 single stack environments. Because the endpoint of Azure Blob Storage does not support IPv6, there is no workaround in place for this issue.
+
For more information, see link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-4433[PROJQUAY-4433]. 

* Currently, attempting to configure your {productname} deployment with Amazon S3 CloudFront will not work on IPv6 single stack environments. Because the endpoint of Amazon S3 CloudFront does not support IPv6, there is no workaround in place for this issue. 
+
For more information, see link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-4470[PROJQUAY-4470]. 

* Currently, OpenShift Data Foundations (ODF) is unsupported when {productname} is deployed on IPv6 single stack environments. As a result, ODF cannot be used in IPv6 environments. This limitation is scheduled to be fixed in a future version of OpenShift Data Foundations. 

* Currently, IPv6 and dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6) support does not work on {productname} {ocp} deployments. When {productname} 3.8 is deployed on {ocp} with IPv6 and dual-stack support enabled, the Quay Route generated by the {productname} Operator only generates an IPv4 address, and not an IPv6 address. As a result, clients with an IPv6 address cannot access the {productname} application on {ocp}. This limitation is scheduled to be fixed in a future version of {ocp}.
