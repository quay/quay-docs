= Troubleshooting {productname} object storage

Object storage is a type of data storage architecture that manages data as discrete units called `objects`. Unlike traditional file systems that organize data into hierarchical directories and files, object storage treats data as independent entities with unique identifiers. Each object contains the data itself, along with metadata that describes the object and enables efficient retrieval.

{productname} uses object storage as the underlying storage mechanism for storing and managing container images. It stores container images as individual objects. Each container image is treated as an object, with its own unique identifier and associated metadata.
