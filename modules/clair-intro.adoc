= {productname} vulnerability scanning using Clair

Clair is equipped with three types of scanners, and a matcher and an updater:

- **Distribution Scanner**: This scanner discovers `Distribution` information, which is typically the base operator system the layer demonstrates features of. 

- **Package Scanner**: This scanner performs a package scan on the selected layer and returns all of the found packages. 

- **Repository Scanner**: This scanner discovers any package repositories that are present in the layers.

- **Matcher**: Matcher implementation is responsible for telling ClairCore which packages to query, how to query the security advisory database, and whether the discovered `Vulnerability` from the security advisory database affects the provided package. 

- **Updater**: The updater is responsible for fetching a security advisory database and parsing the contents.
