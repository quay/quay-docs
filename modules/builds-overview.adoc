= {productname} builds overview

[role="_abstract"]
The {product-title} builds feature automates container image builds from Dockerfiles using worker nodes. You can trigger builds manually or automatically via webhooks to integrate CI/CD pipelines into your workflow.

The _builds_ feature is supported on {productname-ocp} and Kubernetes clusters. For Operator-based deployments and Kubernetes clusters, _builds_ are created by using a _build manager_ that coordinates and handles the build jobs. _Builds_ support building Dockerfile on both bare metal platforms and on virtualized platforms with _virtual builders_. This versatility allows organizations to adapt to existing infrastructure while leveraging {productname}'s container image build capabilities.

The key features of _{productname} builds_ feature include:

* Automated builds triggered by code commits or version control events
* Support for Docker and Podman container images
* Fine-grained control over build environments and resources
* Integration with Kubernetes and {ocp} for scalable builds
* Compatibility with bare metal and virtualized infrastructure

[NOTE]
====
Running _builds_ directly in a container on bare metal platforms does not have the same isolation as when using virtual machines, however, it still provides good protection.
====

_Builds_ are highly complex, and administrators are encouraged to review the link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/red_hat_quay_architecture/index#arch-intro-build-automation[Build automation] architecture guide before continuing.
