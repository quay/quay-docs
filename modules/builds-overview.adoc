= {productname} builds overview

_{productname} builds_, or just _builds_, are a feature that enable the automation of container image builds. The _builds_ feature uses worker nodes to build images from Dockerfiles or other build specifications. These builds can be triggered manually or automatically via webhooks from repositories like GitHub, allowing users to integrate continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) pipelines into their workflow.

The _builds_ feature is supported on {productname-ocp} and Kubernetes clusters. For Operator-based deployments and Kubernetes clusters, _builds_ are created by using a _build manager_ that coordinates and handles the build jobs. _Builds_ support building Dockerfile on both bare metal platforms and on virtualized platforms with _virtual builders_. This versatility allows organizations to adapt to existing infrastructure while leveraging {productname}'s container image build capabilities.

The key features of _{productname} builds_ feature include:

* Automated builds triggered by code commits or version control events
* Support for Docker and Podman container images
* Fine-grained control over build environments and resources
* Integration with Kubernetes and {ocp} for scalable builds
* Compatibility with bare metal and virtualized infrastructure

[NOTE]
====
Running _builds_ directly in a container on bare metal platforms does not have the same isolation as when using virtual machines, however, it still provides good protection.
====

_Builds_ are highly complex, and administrators are encouraged to review the link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/red_hat_quay_architecture/index#arch-intro-build-automation[Build automation] architecture guide before continuing.
