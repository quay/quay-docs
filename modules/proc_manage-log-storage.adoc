= Configuring action log storage for Elasticsearch and Splunk

By default, usage logs are stored in the {productname} database and exposed through the web UI on organization and repository levels. Appropriate administrative privileges are required to see log entries. For deployments with a large amount of logged operations, you can store the usage logs in Elasticsearch and Splunk instead of the {productname} database backend.
