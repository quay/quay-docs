= Troubleshooting Builds

The _builder_ instances started by the _build manager_ are ephemeral. This means that they will either get shut down by {productname} on timeouts or failure, or garbage collected by the control plane (EC2/K8s). In order to obtain the _builds_ logs, you must do so while the _builds_ are running.

[id="debug-config-flag"]
== DEBUG config flag

The `DEBUG` flag can be set to `true` in order to prevent the _builder_ instances from getting cleaned up after completion or failure. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
  EXECUTORS:
    - EXECUTOR: ec2
      DEBUG: true
      ...
    - EXECUTOR: kubernetes
      DEBUG: true
      ...
----

When set to `true`, the debug feature prevents the _build nodes_ from shutting down after the `quay-builder` service is done or fails. It also prevents the _build manager_ from cleaning up the instances by terminating EC2 instances or deleting Kubernetes jobs. This allows debugging _builder node_ issues. 

Debugging should not be set in a production cycle. The lifetime service still exists; for example, the instance still shuts down after approximately two hours. When this happens, EC2 instances are terminated and Kubernetes jobs are completed. 

Enabling debug also affects the `ALLOWED_WORKER_COUNT` because the unterminated instances and jobs still count toward the total number of running workers. As a result, the existing _builder workers_ must be manually deleted if `ALLOWED_WORKER_COUNT` is reached to be able to schedule new _builds_.

== Troubleshooting Amazon EC2

Use the following procedure to troubleshoot Amazon EC2 Builds.

.Procedure

. Start a Build in {productname}.

. In the EC2 console, identify the Build instance. Build instances are named `Quay Ephemeral Builder` and have the tag {`<Build_UUID>: <uuid>`}

. Using the SSH key set by the `EC2_KEY_NAME` configuration field, log in to the Builder instance by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ssh -i /path/to/ssh/key/in/ec2/or/config/id_rsa core@<instance_ip>
----

. Obtain the `quay-builder` service logs by entering the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ systemctl status quay-builder
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ journalctl -f -u quay-builder

== Troubleshooting {ocp} and Kubernetes Builds

Use the following procedure to troubleshooting {ocp} Kubernetes Builds.

.Procedure

. Create a port forwarding tunnel between your local machine and a pod running with either an {ocp} cluster or a Kubernetes cluster by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc port-forward <builder_pod> 9999:2222
----

. Establish an SSH connection to the remote host using a specified SSH key and port, for example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ssh -i /path/to/ssh/key/set/in/ssh_authorized_keys -p 9999 core@localhost
----

. Obtain the `quay-builder` service logs by entering the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ systemctl status quay-builder
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ journalctl -f -u quay-builder
----
