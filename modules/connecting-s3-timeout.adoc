= Connection to AWS s3 bucket errors out

In some cases, {productname} attempts to connect to the s3 bucket that is described in a `config.yaml` file and errors out. Running {productname} in debug might reveal the following error: `gunicorn-registry stdout | 2022-10-21 14:38:36,892 [253] [DEBUG] [urllib3.connectionpool] https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com:443 "POST /quay-bucket-1/storage/quayregistrystorage/uploads/23cd6e62-264c-48e4-94a7-21061b0e4ef1?uploads HTTP/1.1" 400 None`. 

This error occurs because the URL format of a bucket is one of two options. For example:

* `\http://s3.amazonaws.com/[bucket_name]/`
* `http://[bucket_name].s3.amazonaws.com/`

To resolve this issue, you must add the `s3_region` configuration parameter to your `config.yaml` file. This field is not currently embedded in the {productname} config editor, so it must be manually added. If this field is not present in your `config.yaml` file, the Authorization header explicitly mentions a different region and not the region set in the `hostname` field of your `config.yaml` file. 

The following `config.yaml` excerpt is the correct configuration when using AWS:
