= Configuring resource requests by using the CLI

You can re-configure {productname} to configure resource requests after you have already deployed a registry. This can be done by editing the `QuayRegistry` YAML file directly and then re-deploying the registry. 

.Procedure

. Edit the `QuayRegistry` CR by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit quayregistry <registry_name> -n <namespace>
----

. Make any desired changes. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
    - kind: quay
      managed: true
      overrides:
        resources:
          limits: {}
          requests:
            cpu: "0.7"   # Requesting 0.7 CPU (equivalent to 500m or 500 millicpu)
            memory: "512Mi"   # Requesting 512 Mebibytes of memory
----

. Save the changes.
