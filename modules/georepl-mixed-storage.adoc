= Mixed storage for geo-replication

Quay geo-replication supports the use of different, and multiple, replication targets for example, using AWS S3 storage on public cloud and using Ceph storage on-prem. 
This complicates the key requirement of granting access to all storage backends from all Quay pods and cluster nodes. As a result, it is recommended that you:

* Use a VPN to prevent visibility of the internal storage _or_
* Use a token pair that only allows access to the specified bucket used by Quay

This will result in the public cloud instance of Quay having access to on-prem storage but the network will be encrypted, protected, and will use ACLs, thereby meeting security requirements.

If you cannot implement these security measures, it may be preferable to deploy two distinct Quay registries and to use repository mirroring as an alternative to geo-replication.
