[[georepl-mixed-storage]]
= Mixed storage for geo-replication

Technically supported by Quay geo-replication is to use different and multiple replication targets (such as AWS S3 on public cloud and Ceph on-prem)
This further complicates the key requirement of granting access to all storage backends from all Quay pods and cluster nodes
Recommendation: 
Use a VPN to prevent others from being able to even see the internal storage 
Use a token pair that only allows access to the specified bucket used by Quay
Result: now Quay on cloud has access to on prem storage but its network encrypted, protected, and ACLed (and might better meet security requirements)
Alternative: use two distinct Quay registries and repository mirroring
