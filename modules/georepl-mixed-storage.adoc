= Mixed storage for geo-replication

[role="_abstract"]
Geo-replication supports using different storage backends, such as AWS S3 in public cloud and Ceph on-premise, for replication targets. You must grant access to all storage backends from all {productname} pods and cluster nodes, so use a VPN or token pair with bucket-specific access to meet security requirements.

Because geo-replication supports multiple replication targets, it is recommended to use a VPN or token pair with bucket-specific access to meet security requirements. This results in the public cloud instance of {productname} having access to on-premise storage, but the network is encrypted, protected, and uses ACLs, thereby meeting security requirements. If you cannot implement these security measures, it might be preferable to deploy two distinct {productname} registries and to use repository mirroring as an alternative to geo-replication.
