[id="supported-aws-storage-backends"]
= Supported AWS storage backends

{productname} supports multiple Amazon Web Services (AWS) storage backends:

* *S3 storage*: Standard support for AWS S3 buckets that uses AWS's native object storage service.
* *STS S3 storage*: Support for AWS Security Token Service (STS) to assume IAM roles, allowing for more secure S3 operations.
* *CloudFront S3 storage*: Integrates with AWS CloudFront to enable high-availability distribution of content while still using AWS S3 as the origin.

The following sections provide example YAMLs and additional information about each AWS storage backend.

[id="config-fields-storage-aws"]
== Amazon Web Services S3 storage

{productname} supports using AWS S3 as an object storage backend. AWS S3 is an object storage service designed for data availability, scalability, security, and performance. The following YAML shows an example configuration using AWS S3.

<1> The `S3Storage` storage driver should only be used for AWS S3 buckets. Note that this differs from general S3 access, where the RadosGW driver or other storage services can be used. For an example, see "Example B: Using RadosGW with general S3 access".
<2> The Amazon Web Services region. Defaults to `us-east-1`.

[id="config-fields-storage-aws-sts"]
== Amazon Web Services STS S3 storage

AWS Security Token Service (STS) provides temporary, limited-privilege credentials for accessing AWS resources, improving security by avoiding the need to store long-term access keys. This is useful in environments such as {ocp} where credentials can be rotated or managed through IAM roles.

The following YAML shows an example configuration for using AWS STS with {productname-ocp} configurations.

[id="aws-cloudfront-storage-example"]
== AWS CloudFront storage

AWS CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service that caches and distributes content closer to users for improved performance and lower latency. {productname} supports CloudFront through the `CloudFrontedS3Storage` driver, which enables secure, signed access to S3 buckets via CloudFront distributions.

Use the following example when configuring AWS CloudFront for your {productname} deployment.

[NOTE]
====
* When configuring AWS Cloudfront storage, the following conditions must be met for proper use with {productname}:
** You must set an *Origin path* that is consistent with {productname}'s storage path as defined in your `config.yaml` file. Failure to meet this require results in a `403` error when pulling an image. For more information, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesOriginPath[Origin path].
** You must configure a link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/secure-content-delivery-amazon-cloudfront/s3-origin-with-cloudfront.html[*Bucket policy*] and a link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/cors.html[*Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)*] policy.
