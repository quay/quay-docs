= Redis

Quay stores builder logs inside a Redis cache. The data stored is ephemeral in nature and as such, Redis does not need to be HA even though it is stateful. if Redis does fail, you will only lose access to build logs.

You can use a Redis image from the Red Hat Software Collections or from any other source you prefer.
