= Redis

{productname} stores builder logs inside a Redis cache. Because the data stored is ephemeral, Redis does not need to be highly available even though it is stateful.

If Redis fails, you will lose access to build logs, builders, and the garbage collector service. Additionally, user events will be unavailable.

You can use a Redis image from the Red Hat Software Collections or from any other source you prefer.
