== Version 3.6.0

=== quay / clair / quay-builder

Added/Changed: 

* {productname} 3.6 now includes support for Open Container Initiative (OCI) mimetypes, including CLI cosigning, helm, and alternate compression schemes such as ztsd. (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-1417?filter=12382147[PROQUAY-1417]), (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-1032?filter=12382147[PROJQUAY-1032]) 

* You can now use the API to create a first user. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-1926?filter=12382147[PROJQUAY-1926])

* Support for nested repositories and extended repository names has been added. This change allows the use of `/` in repository names needed for certain OpenShift Container Platform use cases. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-1535?filter=12382147[PROJQUAY-1535]) 

* Registry users now have the option to set `CREATE_PRIVATE_REPO_ON_PUSH` in their config.yaml to `True` or `False` depending on their security needs. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-1929?filter=12382147[PROJQUAY-1929]) 

* Pushing to a non-existent organization can now be configured to automatically create the organization. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-1928?filter=12382147[PROJQUAY-1928])

* Users are now required to enter namespace and repository names when deleting a repository. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-763?filter=12382147[PROJQUAY-763]) 

* Support for Ceph virtual-hosted-style bucket addressing has been added. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-922?filter=12382147[PROJQUAY-922])

* Users can now view Clair v4.2 enrichment data in the Quay UI. Additionally, Clair v4.2 shows vulnerability status for detected vulnerabilities in Alpine Images. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-2102?filter=12382147[PROJQUAY-2102]) 

* The Quay Repository now shows *Repository Status* when repository mirroring is enabled. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-591?filter=12382147[PROJQUAY-591]) 

* Memory usage across Clair, notably around the `affected_manifests` call, has been improved. These changesets include: 

** `io.Pipe` is used to cross-wire JSON encoding and API requests in order to avoid buffering the entire body request in memory; 
** `encoding/JSON` has been replaced with `github.com/ugorji/go/codec` configured for JSON in order to allow streaming the JSON encoding;
** `affected_manifests` calls in the notifier, which should prevent large vulnerability turnovers from causing extremely large API calls.

Fixed:

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-1918?filter=12382147[PROJQUAY-1918]. Clair v4.1.0.alpha2 indexer now works in {productname} 3.6. 

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-1610?filter=12382147[PROJQUAY-1610]. The `initContainer` from the Quay migration pod has been removed, which blocked the deployment process until Clair responded. As a result, Quay deployments now progress without waiting on the Clair deployment to finish. 

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-1857?filter=12382147[PROJQUAY-1857]. NamespaceGCWorker and RepositoryGCWorker shuts down when unable to acquire lock

Deprecated:

* *FEATURE_HELM_OCI_SUPPORT*: This feature has been deprecated as of {productname} 3.6 and will be removed in a future release. Instead, `OCI artifact config` should be used, which offers the same features. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-2334[PROJQUAY-2334])

* *MySQL and MariaDB database support*: The MySQL and mariaDB databases have been deprecated as of {productname} 3.6. Support for these databases will be removed in a future version of {productname}. If starting a new {productname} installation, it is strongly recommended to use PostgreSQL. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-1998?filter=12382147[PROJQUAY-1998])

=== quay-operator

* {productname} 3.6 adds a `disconnected` annotation to Operators. For example: 
+
[source,yaml]
----
metadata:
  annotations:
    operators.openshift.io/infrastructure-features: '["disconnected"]'
----
+
For more information, see link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-1583?filter=12382147[PROJQUAY-1583].

* In order to properly support Github actions, `RELATED_IMAGE` values can now be referenced by tag name (`name:tag`) or by digest (`name@sha256:123`). (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-1887?filter=12382147[PROJQUAY-1887]), (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-1890?filter=12382147[PROJQUAY-1890])

* `HorizontalPodAutoscalers` have been added to the Clair, Quay, and Mirror pods, so that they now automatically scale during load spikes. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-1449?filter=12382147[PROJQUAY-1449]) 

* The Quay Operator now reports the status of each managed component in a separate index inside of the same status property so that users can see the progress of a deployment or update. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-1609?filter=12382147[PROJQUAY-1609]) 

* `ssl.cert` and `ssl.key` are now moved to a separate, persistent Secret, which ensures that the cert/key pair is not re-generated upon every reconcile. These are now formatted as `edge` routes and mounted to the same directory in the Quay container. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-1883?filter=12382147[PROJQUAY-1883]) 

* Support for OpenShift Container Platform Edge-Termination Routes has been added by way of a new managed component--`tls`. This separates the `Route` component from TLS and allows users to configure both separate. `EXTERNAL_TLS_TERMINATION: true` is the opinionated setting. Managed `tls` means that the default cluster wildcart cert is used. Unamanged `tls` means that the user provided cert/key pair will be injected into the `Route`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-2050?filter=12382147[PROJQUAY-2050])

* The {productname} Operator can now be directly upgraded from 3.3 to 3.6 without regressions in `Route` handling, rollout speed, stability, and reconciliation robustness. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-2100?filter=12382147[PROJQUAY-2100])

* The Quay Operator now allows for more than one Mirroring pod. Users are also no longer required to manually adjust the Mirroring Pod deployment.(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-1327?filter=12382147[PROJQUAY-1327])  

* Previously, when running a 3.3.x version of {productname} with edge routing enabled, users were unable to upgrade to 3.4.x versions of {productname}. This has been resolved with the release of {productname} 3.6. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-1694?filter=12382147[PROJQUAY-1694])

* Users now have the option to set a minimum number of replica Quay pods when `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` is set. This reduces downtime when updating or reconfiguring Quay via the Operator during rescheduling events. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-1763?filter=12382147[PROJQUAY-1763]) 

Known issues:

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-2335[PROJQUAY-2335]. `Quay` Operator deployment should be blocked when TLS cert/key pairs are unprovided. Instead, the `Quay` Operator continues to deploy. 

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-2389[PROJQUAY-2389]. Customer provided TLS certificates are lost after {productname} 3.6 Operator reconcile.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-2121?filter=12382147[PROJQUAY-2121]. Quay upgrade pods running all workers instead of just database upgrade


=== quay-container-security-operator

* The Operator Lifecycle Manager now supports the new v1 CRD API, `apiextensions.k8s.io.v1.CustomResourceDefinition` for the Container Security Operator. This CRD should be used instead of the `v1beta1` CRD, which has been deprecated as of OpenShift Container Platform 4.9. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-613?filter=12382147[PROJQUAY-613]),  (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-1791?filter=12382147[PROJQUAY-1791])


=== quay-openshift-bridge-operators

* The installation experience for the Quay Bridge Operator (QBO) has been improved. Enhancements include the following:
** `MutatingAdmissionWebhook` is created automatically during install. 
** The QBO leverages the Operator Lifecycle Manager feature of auto-generating certificates and webhook configurations.
** The number of manual steps required to get the Quay Bridge Operator running has been decreased. 
+
For more information, see link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-672?filter=12382147[PROJQUAY-672].

* The certificate manager is now delegated by the Operator Lifecycle Manager. Certificates can now be valid for more than 65 days. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-1062?filter=12382147[PROJQUAY-1062])
