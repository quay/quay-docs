= Troubleshooting Clair issue

Use the following procedures to troubleshoot Clair. 

[id="verify-image-compatibility"]
== Verifying image compatibility

If you are using Clair, ensure that the images you are trying to scan are supported by Clair. Clair has certain requirements and does not support all image formats or configurations.

For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html/manage_red_hat_quay/clair-vulnerability-scanner#clair-vulnerability-scanner-hosts[Clair vulnerability databases]. 

[id="allowlist-clair-updaters"]
== Allowlisting Clair updaters

If you are using Clair behind a proxy configuration, you must allowlist the updaters in your proxy or firewall configuration. For more information about updater URLs, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html/vulnerability_reporting_with_clair_on_red_hat_quay/clair-concepts#clair-updater-urls[Clair updater URLs].

[id="clair-dependencies-update"]
== Updating Clair scanner and its dependencies 

Ensure that you are using the latest version of Clair security scanner. Outdated versions might lack support for newer image formats, or might have known issues. 

Use the following procedure to check your version of Clair. 

[NOTE]
====
Checking Clair logs can also be used to check if there are any errors from the updaters microservice in your Clair logs. By default, Clair updates the vulnerability database every 30 minutes. 
====

.Procedure

. Check your version of Clair.

.. If you are running Clair on {productname-ocp}, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs clair-pod
----

.. If you are running a standalone deployment of {productname} and using a Clair container, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman logs clair-container
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
"level":"info",
"component":"main",
"version":"v4.5.1",
----

[id="enabling-debug-mode-clair"]
== Enabling debug mode for Clair

By default, debug mode for Clair is disabled. You can enable debug mode for Clair by updating your `clair-config.yaml` file.

.Prerequisites

* For Clair on {productname-ocp} deployments, you must link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_quay/3.12/html-single/vulnerability_reporting_with_clair_on_red_hat_quay/index#custom-clair-configuration-managed-database[Running a custom Clair configuration with a managed Clair database].

Use the following procedure to enable debug mode for Clair.

.Procedure

. Update your `clair-config.yaml` file to include the debug option. 

.. On standalone {productname} deployments:

... Add the following configuration field to your `clair-config.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
log_level: debug
----

... Restart your Clair deployment by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman restart <clair_container_name>
----

.. On {productname-ocp} deployments:

... On the {ocp} web console, click *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* -> *Quay Registry*. 

... Click the name of your registry, for example, *Example Registry*. You are redirected to the *Details* page of your registry.

... Click the Config Bundle Secret, for example, *example-registry-config-bundle-xncls*. 

... Confirm that you are running a custom Clair configuration by looking for the `clair-config.yaml` file under the *Data* section of the *Details* page of your secret. 

... If you have a `clair-config.yaml` file, click *Actions* -> *Edit Secret*. If you do not, see "Running a custom Clair configuration with a managed Clair database". 

... Update your `clair-config.yaml` file to include the `log_level: debug` configuration variable. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
log_level: debug
----

... Click *Save*. 

... You can check the status of your Clair deployment by clicking *Workloads* -> *Pods*. The `clair-app` pod should report `1/1` under the *Ready* category. 

... You can confirm that Clair is returning debugging information by clicking the *clair-app* pod that is ready -> *Logs*.

[id="checking-clair-configuration"]
== Checking Clair configuration 

Check your Clair `config.yaml` file to ensure that there are no misconfigurations or inconsistencies that could lead to issues. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html-single/vulnerability_reporting_with_clair_on_red_hat_quay/index#config-fields-overview[Clair configuration overview].

[id="inspect-image-metadata"]
== Inspect image metadata 

In some cases, you might receive an *Unsupported* message. This might indicate that the scanner is unable to extract the necessary metadata from the image. Check if the image metadata is properly formatted and accessible. 

[role="_additional-resources"]
.Additional resources

For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7018077[Troubleshooting Clair].

[id="check-logs-updaters-errors"]
== Checking logs for updaters errors 

Check if there are any errors from the updaters microservice in your Clair logs. By default, Clair updates the vulnerability database every 30 minutes. 

Use the following procedure to check your Clair logs.

.Procedure 

. Check your Clair logs.

.. If you are running Clair on the {productname} Operator, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs clair-pod
----

.. If you are running a standalone deployment of {productname} and using a Clair container, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman logs clair-container
----


[id="updating-cve-database"]
== Updating the CVE database 

Updating the CVE database can be a memory and CPU intensive task, especially if there are several CVEs that must be parsed. If the resources are exhausted during this process, the system kernel can stop the offending process. This should be visible in Docker logs, Podman logs, or in the system journal. For example:
