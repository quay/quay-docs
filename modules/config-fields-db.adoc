= Database configuration

This section describes the database configuration fields available for {productname} deployments. 

[id="database-uri"]
== Database URI

With {productname}, connection to the database is configured by using the required `DB_URI` field. 

The following table describes the `DB_URI` configuration field: 

.Database URI
[cols="3a,1a,2a",options="header"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description 
| **DB_URI** +
(Required) | String | The URI for accessing the database, including any credentials.

Example `DB_URI` field:

*postgresql://quayuser:quaypass@quay-server.example.com:5432/quay*
|===

[id="database-connection-arguments"]
== Database connection arguments

Optional connection arguments are configured by the `DB_CONNECTION_ARGS` parameter. Some of the key-value pairs defined under `DB_CONNECTION_ARGS` are generic, while others are database specific. 

The following table describes database connection arguments: 

.Database connection arguments
[cols="3a,1a,2a",options="header"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description 
| **DB_CONNECTION_ARGS** | Object | Optional connection arguments for the database, such as timeouts and SSL.
| **.autorollback**| Boolean | Whether to use thread-local connections. +
Should always be `true` 
| **.threadlocals**| Boolean | Whether to use auto-rollback connections. + 
Should always be `true` 
// TODO 36 max_connections, timeout, stale_timeout
// | {nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}.max_connections| Number | 
// | {nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}.timeout | Number | 
// | {nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}.stale_timeout | Number |

[id="config-fields-postgres"]
=== PostgreSQL SSL connection arguments

With SSL, configuration depends on the database you are deploying. The following example shows a PostgreSQL SSL configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
DB_CONNECTION_ARGS:
  sslmode: verify-ca
  sslrootcert: /path/to/cacert
----

The `sslmode` option determines whether, or with, what priority a secure SSL TCP/IP connection will be negotiated with the server. There are six modes:

.SSL options 
[options="header"]
|=== 
|Mode |Description

| **disable** | Your configuration only tries non-SSL connections. 
| **allow** | Your configuration first tries a non-SSL connection. Upon failure, tries an SSL connection.
| **prefer** +
(Default) | Your configuration first tries an SSL connection. Upon failure, tries a non-SSL connection. 
| **require** | Your configuration only tries an SSL connection. If a root CA file is present, it verifies the certificate in the same way as if verify-ca was specified. 
| **verify-ca** | Your configuration only tries an SSL connection, and verifies that the server certificate is issued by a trusted certificate authority (CA). 
| **verify-full** | Only tries an SSL connection, and verifies that the server certificate is issued by a trusted CA and that the requested server host name matches that in the certificate.

[id="mysql-ssl-connection-arguments"]
=== MySQL SSL connection arguments

The following example shows a sample MySQL SSL configuration: 

[source.yaml]
----
DB_CONNECTION_ARGS:
  ssl: 
    ca: /path/to/cacert
----
