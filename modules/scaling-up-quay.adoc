= Scaling up the {productname} deployment

[role="_abstract"]
To scale up your {productname} deployment, you can re-enable auto scaling and remove replica overrides. This restores your registry to normal operation after scaling down.

.Procedure

* Scale up the {productname} deployment by re-enabling auto scaling, if desired, and removing the replica overrides for Quay, mirror workers and Clair as applicable. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: quay.redhat.com/v1
kind: QuayRegistry
metadata:
  name: registry
  namespace: ns
spec:
  components:
    …
    - kind: horizontalpodautoscaler
      managed: true <1>
    - kind: quay <2>
      managed: true
    - kind: clair
      managed: true
    - kind: mirror
      managed: true
    …
----

where:

`managed: true::` Re-enables auto scaling of {productname}, Clair and mirroring workers again.

`overrides::` Replica overrides are removed again to scale the {productname} components back up.
