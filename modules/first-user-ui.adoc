= Creating the first user by using the UI

[role="_abstract"]
Creating the first user by using the UI offers a visual workflow and is often preferred after initial setup to ensure that the user interface is functional. For most users, the UI offers a simpler path to creating the first user, as it does not require additional configuration in the `config.yaml` file.
