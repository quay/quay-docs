= Removing a geo-replicated site from your standalone {productname} deployment

By using the following procedure, {productname} administrators can remove sites in a geo-replicated setup. 

.Prerequisites 

* You have configured {productname} geo-replication with at least two sites, for example, `usstorage` and `eustorage`. 
* Each site has its own Organization, Repository, and image tags. 

.Procedure

. Sync the blobs between all of your defined sites by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ python -m util.backfillreplication
----
+
[WARNING]
====
Prior to removing storage engines from your {productname} `config.yaml` file, you *must* ensure that all blobs are synced between all defined sites. Complete this step before proceeding. 
====

. In your {productname} `config.yaml` file for site `usstorage`, remove the `DISTRIBUTED_STORAGE_CONFIG` entry for the `eustorage` site. 

. Enter the following command to obtain a list of running containers:
+
[source,terminal]
