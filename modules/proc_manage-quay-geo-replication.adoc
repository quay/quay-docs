[[georeplication-of-storage-in-quay]]
= Georeplication of storage in {productname}

Georeplication allows for a single globally-distributed {productname}
to serve container images from localized storage.

When georeplication is configured, container image pushes will be
written to the preferred storage engine for that {productname} instance. After the
initial push, image data will be replicated in the background to other
storage engines. The list of replication locations is configurable. An
image pull will always use the closest available storage engine, to
maximize pull performance.

[[prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

Georeplication requires that there be a high availability storage engine
(S3, GCS, RADOS, Swift) in each geographic region. Further, each region
must be able to access *every* storage engine due to replication
requirements.

[NOTE]
====
Local disk storage is not compatible with georeplication at this
time.

== Visit the Config Tool

Open the {productname} Config Tool to configure storage for georeplication.

[[enable-storage-replication]]
== Enable storage replication

.  Scroll down to the section
entitled `Registry Storage`.
.  Click `Enable Storage Replication`.
.  Add each of the storage engines to which data will be replicated.
All storage engines to be used must be listed.
.  If complete replication of all images to all storage engines is
required, under each storage engine configuration click `Replicate to
storage engine by default`. This will ensure that all images are
replicated to that storage engine. To instead enable per-namespace
replication, please contact support.
.  When you are done, click `Save Configuration Changes`.
Configuration changes will take effect the next time {productname} restarts.

.  After adding storage and enabling “Replicate to storage engine by default” for Georeplications, you need to sync existing image data across all storage.
To do this, you need to `oc exec` (or docker/kubectl exec) into the container
and run:
+
```
# scl enable python27 bash
# python -m util.backfillreplication
```
+
This is a one time operation to sync content after adding new storage.

[[run-quay-with-storage-preferences]]
== Run {productname} with storage preferences

.  Copy the config.yaml to all machines running {productname}

.  For each machine in each region, add a
`QUAY_DISTRIBUTED_STORAGE_PREFERENCE` environment variable with the
preferred storage engine for the region in which the machine is running.
+
For example, for a machine running in Europe with the config
directory on the host available from /mnt/quay/config:
ifdef::upstream[]
+
[source,yaml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]

# docker login quay.io

    <registry>/<repo>/quay:{productmin}

    {productrepo}/{quayimage}:{productminv}

[NOTE]
====
The value of the environment variable specified must match the
name of a Location ID as defined in the config panel.

.  Restart all {productname} containers
