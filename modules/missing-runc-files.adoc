= Missing runc files prevent containers from running

When attempting to start containers using the Podman client tool, users encounter an error due to missing runc files. The error message indicates a permission issue related to adding a seccomp filter rule for the `bdflush` syscall, leading to the container startup failure.

The cause of this issue is the absence of required `runc` files in the older version of Podman. These missing files prevent the proper execution of containers, resulting in the encountered error. Updating Podman ensures that the necessary runc files are present, enabling the successful deployment of containers.

To resolve this issue, it is recommended to update the Podman version to obtain the updated `runc` files. By updating Podman, the missing runc files will be installed, allowing containers to be deployed successfully.

Use the following command to update Podman:
[source,terminal]
----
# yum update podman -y
----

After updating Podman, restart the containers, and the error caused by missing runc files should no longer occur.
