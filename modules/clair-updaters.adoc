= Clair updaters

Clair uses `Go` packages called _updaters_ that contain the logic of fetching and parsing different vulnerability databases.

Updaters are usually paired with a matcher to interpret if, and how, any vulnerability is related to a package. Administrators might want to update the vulnerability database less frequently, or not import vulnerabilities from databases that they know will not be used.
