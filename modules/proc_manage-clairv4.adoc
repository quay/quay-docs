[[clair-v4]]
= Clair Security Scanning

== What is Clair?

Clair is a set of micro services that can be used with {productname}
to perform vulnerability scanning of container images associated with a set of
Linux operating systems. The micro services design of Clair makes it
appropriate to run in a highly scalable configuration, where
components can be scaled separately as appropriate for enterprise environments.

Clair uses the following vulnerability databases to scan for issues in your images:

* Alpine SecDB database
* AWS UpdateInfo
* Debian Oval database
* Oracle Oval database
* RHEL Oval database
* SUSE Oval database
* Ubuntu Oval database
* Pyup.io (python) database

For information on how Clair does security mapping with the different databases, see
link:https://quay.github.io/claircore/concepts/severity_mapping.html[ClairCore Severity Mapping].

[NOTE]
====

ifeval::["{productname}" == "Red Hat Quay"]
With the release of Red Hat Quay 3.4, the new Clair V4 (image {productrepo}/{clairimage} fully replaces the prior Clair V2 (image quay.io/redhat/clair-jwt). See below for how to run V2 in read-only mode while V4 is updating.

ifeval::["{productname}" == "Project Quay"]
With the release of Clair V4 (image clair), the previously used Clair V2 (image clair-jwt) is no longer used. See below for how to run V2 in read-only mode while V4 is updating.

====

=== Running Clair V4 and Clair V2 Simultaneously

While Clair V4 ({productrepo}/{clairimage}:{productminv}) is the version of Clair that {productname} uses, both it and the prior Clair V2 (quay.io/redhat/clair-jwt) can run concurrently with {productname}. This is useful for existing {productname} deployments that have relied on Clair V2 but wish to have no interruption of scan results using Clair V4. All new image scans will happen in Clair V4 and existing images will be re-scanned automatically. When scan results are requested through {productname}, if the new Clair V4 results are not available, the existing Clair V2 results will be retrieved. Once the Clair V2 scan results are not needed, it may be decommissioned and removed from {productname}'s configuration.

The progress of rescanning images may be monitored via {productname} API. (Refer to link:use_quay.html#_accessing_your_quay_api_from_a_web_browser[Using The Quay API] for details):

```
/secscan/_backfill_status
```
This will produce a simple JSON response with the percentage of completed manifests scanned by Clair V4:

[source,json]
```
{"backfill_percent": 73.4}
```

Once the majority of the images in your registry have been scanned by Clair V4, the Clair V2 deployment should be removed entirely (both running containers and removal from config).


== Setting Up Clair on a {productname} OpenShift deloyment

=== Deploying Via the Quay Operator
To set up Clair V4 on a new {productname} deployment on OpenShift, it is highly recommended to use the Quay Operator.  By default, the Quay Operator will install or upgrade a Clair deployment along with your {productname} deployment and configure Clair security scanning automatically. 

=== Manually Deploying Clair
To configure Clair V4 on an existing {productname} OpenShift deployment running Clair V2, first ensure {productname} has been upgraded to at least version 3.4.0.  Then use the following steps to manually set up Clair V4 alongside Clair V2.

. Set your current project to the name of the project in which {productname} is running.
For example:
+
```
$ oc project quay-enterprise
```

. Create a Postgres deployment file for Clair v4 (for example, `clairv4-postgres.yaml`)
as follows.
+
.clairv4-postgres.yaml
[source,yaml]

<1> Change image to latest clair image name and version.
<2> With the Service set to clairv4, the scanner endpoint for Clair v4
is entered later into the {productname} config.yaml in the
`SECURITY_SCANNER_V4_ENDPOINT` as `http://clairv4`.

. Create the Clair v4 deployment as follows:
+
```
$ oc create -f ./clair-combo.yaml
```

. Modify the `config.yaml` file for your {productname} deployment to add the following
entries at the end:
+
[source,yaml]
----
FEATURE_SECURITY_SCANNER: true
SECURITY_SCANNER_V4_ENDPOINT: http://clairv4 <1>
----
<1> Identify the Clair v4 service endpoint


. Redeploy the modified `config.yaml` to the secret containing that file
(for example, `quay-enterprise-config-secret`:
+
```
$ oc delete secret quay-enterprise-config-secret 
$ oc create secret generic quay-enterprise-config-secret --from-file=./config.yaml
```

. For the new `config.yaml` to take effect, you need to restart the
{productname} pods. Simply deleting the `quay-app` pods causes pods
with the updated configuration to be deployed.

At this point, images in any of the organizations identified in the
namespace whitelist will be scanned by Clair v4.

== Setting up Clair on a non-OpenShift {productname} deployment

For {productname} deployments not running on OpenShift, it is possible to configure Clair security scanning manually.  {productname} deployments already running Clair V2 can use the instructions below to add Clair V4 to their deployment.

. Deloy a (preferably fault-tolerant) Postgres database server.  Note that Clair requires the `uuid-ossp` extension to be added to its Postgres database.  If the user supplied in Clair's `config.yaml` has the necessary privileges to create the extension then it will be added automatically by Clair itself.  If not, then the extension must be added before starting Clair.  If the extension is not present, the following error will be displayed when Clair attempts to start.
+
```
ERROR: Please load the "uuid-ossp" extension. (SQLSTATE 42501)
```
+
. Create a Clair config file in a specific folder (e.g. `/etc/clairv4/config/config.yaml`) file.
+
.config.yaml
[source,yaml]

http_listen_addr: :8080

  connstring: host=clairv4-postgres port=5432 dbname=clair user=postgres password=postgres sslmode=disable

  probability: 1
  jaeger:
    agent_endpoint: "localhost:6831"
    service_name: "clair"
metrics:
  name: "prometheus"
----

More information about Clair's configuration format can be found in link:https://quay.github.io/clair/reference/config.html[upstream Clair documentation]. 

. Run Clair via the container image, mounting in the configuration from the file you created.
+
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
```
$ podman run -p 8080:8080 -p 8089:8089 -e CLAIR_CONF=/clair/config.yaml -e CLAIR_MODE=combo -v /etc/clair4/config:/clair -d {productrepo}/{clairimage}:{productminv}
```

. Follow the remaining instructions from the previous section for configuring {productname} to use the new Clair V4 endpoint.

Running multiple Clair containers in this fashion is also possible, but for deployment scenarios beyond a single container the use of a container orchestrator like Kubernetes or OpenShift is strongly recommended.

== Using Clair

. Log in to your {productname} cluster and select an organization for which you have configured
Clair scanning.

. Select a repository from that organization that holds some images and
select Tags from the left navigation. The following figure shows an example
of a repository with two images that have been scanned:
+
image:clair-reposcan.png[Security scan information appears for scanned repository images]

. If vulnerabilities are found, select to under the Security Scan column
for the image to see either all vulnerabilities or those that are fixable. The
following figure shows information on all vulnerabilities found:
+
image:clair-vulnerabilities.png[See all vulnerabilities or only those that are fixable]

== Clair Notifications

When Clair received a new vulnerability affecting a previously indexed manifest, it will notify {productname} so that a new scan can be requested.  Only the most severe vulnerabilities trigger a notification to avoid excessive scan requests.  This notification mechanism is automatically set up when Clair is configured in {productname}'s configuration.

Clair notifications can also be set up for external consumption via AMQP and STOMP protocols.  For details on how to set this up please consult the link:https://quay.github.io/clair/concepts/notifications.html[upstream Clair documentation].

== Configuring Clair for Disconnected Environments

Clair utilizes a set of components called Updaters to handle the fetching and parsing of data from various vulnerability databases.  These Updaters are set up by default to pull vulnerability data directly from the internet and work out of the box.  For customers in disconnected environments without direct access to the internet this poses a problem.  Clair supports these environments through the ability to work with different types of update workflows that take into account network isolation.  Using the `clairctl` command line utility, any process can easily fetch Updater data from the internet via an open host, securely transfer the data to an isolated host, and then import the Updater data on the isolated host into Clair itself.

The steps are as follows.

. First ensure that your Clair configuration has disabled automated Updaters from running.
+
.config.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
matcher:
  disable_updaters: true

----

. Export out the latest Updater data to a local archive.  This requires the `clairctl` tool which can be run directly as a binary, or via the Clair container image.  Assume your Clair configuration is in `/etc/clairv4/config/config.yaml`, to run via the container image:
+
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
```
$ podman run -it --rm -v /etc/clairv4/config:/cfg:Z -v $(pwd):/updaters:Z --entrypoint /bin/clairctl {productrepo}/{clairimage}:{productminv} export-updaters --config /cfg/config.yaml /updaters/updaters.gz
```
+
Note that you need to explicitly reference the Clair configuration.  This will create the Updater archive in `/etc/clairv4/updaters/updaters.gz`.  If you want to ensure the archive was created without any errors from the source databases, you can supply the `--strict` flag to `clairctl`.  The archive file should be copied over to a volume that is accessible from the disconnected host running Clair.  From the disconnected host, use the same procedure now to import the archive into Clair.
+
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
```
$ podman run -it --rm -v /etc/clairv4/config:/cfg:Z -v $(pwd):/updaters:Z --entrypoint /bin/clairctl {productrepo}/{clairimage}:{productminv} import-updaters --config /cfg/config.yaml /updaters/updaters.gz
```
+
