= Using Clair V4 Security Scanning

Clair v4 is the next generation of Clair image scanning available
with {productname}. Clair v4 is currently released as
link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview],
which means that it is not supported for production use. However, you are
encouraged to test Clair v4 as it represents the direction of Clair image scanning
development.

To align with the {productname} release, the current Clair v4 release image
is clair:{productminv}.

== What is Clair v4?

Technically, Clair v4 is a set of micro services that can be used with {productname}
to perform vulnerability scanning of container images associated with a set of
Linux operating systems. The micro services design of Clair v4 makes it
appropriate to run in a highly scalable configuration, where
components can be scaled separately as appropriate for enterprise environments.

For the purposes of trying out Clair v4, we recommend running it in combo mode (see
link:https://github.com/quay/openshift-demo/blob/master/clairv4/clair-combo.yaml[clair-combo.yaml])
This mode, described here, brings all the microservices together as one process.

All supported security databases for Clair v4 are turned on. These databases include:

* Alpine SecDB database
* AWS UpdateInfo
* Debian Oval database
* Oracle Oval database
* RHEL Oval database
* SUSE Oval database
* Ubuntu Oval database

For information on how Clair does security mapping with the different databases, see
link:https://quay.github.io/claircore/v0.0.19/severity_mapping.html[ClairCore Severity Mapping].

[WARNING]
====
Because Clair v4 is Technology Preview, don't expect 100% accurate reporting.
Expect that the presentation of vulnerability results will look different going
forward than they did with v2. Over time, Clair v4 will produce more results.
====

The steps for using Clair v4 alongside an existing {productname} + Clair v2 environment are
described next.

== Configuring Clair v4

To try out Clair v4, stand up a {productname} cluster
with a running Clair v2 instance. Then use the following procedure
to run Clair v4 along side it. Here is how to do that on an OpenShift v4.2 or later cluster on an AWS cloud.

. Set your current project to the name of the project in which {productname} is running.
For example:
+
```
$ oc project quay-enterprise
```

. Create a Postgres deployment file for Clair v4 (for example, `clairv4-postgres.yaml`)
as follows.
+
.clairv4-postgres.yaml
[source,yaml]

. Deploy the postgres database as follows:
+
```
$ oc create -f ./clairv4-postgres.yaml

. Create a Clair config.yaml file to use for Clair v4. For example:
+
.config.yaml

----

. Create a secret from the Clair config.yaml:
+
```
$ oc create secret generic clairv4-config-secret --from-file=./config.yaml
```

. Create the Clair v4 deployment file (for example, `clair-combo.yaml`) and modify it as necessary:

.clair-combo.yaml

<1> Change image to latest clair image name and version.
<2> With the Service set to clairv4, the scanner endpoint for Clair v4
is entered later into the {productname} config.yaml in the
SECURITY_SCANNER_V4_ENDPOINT as http://clairv4.

. Create the Clair v4 deployment as follows:
+
```
$ oc create -f ./clair-combo.yaml
```

. Modify the `config.yaml` file for your {productname} deployment to add the following
entries at the end:
+
[source,yaml]
----
...
FEATURE_SECURITY_SCANNER: true
SECURITY_SCANNER_V4_ENDPOINT: http://clairv4 <1>
SECURITY_SCANNER_V4_NAMESPACE_WHITELIST: <2>
  - "clairv4-org"
  - "foo-org"
----
<1> Identify the Clair v4 service endpoint
<2> Replace `clair4-org` and `foo-org` with namespaces (organizations and
users) in your {productname} cluster you want to use Clair v4 scanning

. Redeploy the modified `config.yaml` to the secret containing that file
(for example, `quay-enterprise-config-secret`:
+
```
$ oc delete secret quay-enterprise-config-secret 
$ oc create secret generic quay-enterprise-config-secret --from-file=./config.yaml
```

. For the new `config.yaml` to take effect, you need to restart the
{productname} pods. Simply deleting the `quay-app` pods causes pods
with the updated configuration to be deployed.

At this point, images in any of the organizations identified in the
namespace whitelist will be scanned by Clair v4.

== Using Clair v4
The user interface for viewing vulnerability information gathered by Clair v4
is essentially the same as it was for Clair v2.

. Log in to your {productname} cluster and select an organization for which you have configured
Clair v4 scanning.

. Select a repository from that organization that holds some images and
select Tags from the left navigation. The following figure shows an example
of a repository with two images that have been scanned:
+
image:clair-reposcan.png[Security scan information appears for scanned repository images]

. If vulnerabilities are found, select to under the Security Scan column
for the image to see either all vulnerabilities or those that are fixable. The
following figure shows information on all vulnerabilities found:
+
image:clair-vulnerabilities.png[See all vulnerabilities or only those that are fixable]
