= Unable to access private repositories using Amazon EC2 Container Service

In some cases, authentication fails while attempting to use Amazon Elastic Container Service (EC2). This error occurs when the authentication configuration in the `ecs.config` file is missing. 

In order for ECS to pull down Docker images, the following information must be included in the ECS configuration file that is located in the `/etc/ecs/ecs.conf` file:

[source,yaml]
----
ECS_ENGINE_AUTH_TYPE=dockercfg
ECS_ENGINE_AUTH_DATA={"https://quay.io": {"auth": "YOURAUTHTOKENFROMDOCKERCFG", "email": "user@example.com"}}
----

If you are using a robot account, you must include the username:

[source,terminal]
----
ECS_ENGINE_AUTH_TYPE=dockercfg <1>
ECS_ENGINE_AUTH_DATA={"https://quay.io": {"auth": "YOURAUTHTOKENFROMDOCKERCFG", "email": ".", "username": "USERNAME"}}
----
<1> This field is the contents of the `auths` attribute in `.docker/config.json` starting at Docker version 1.7.0, or the contents of `.dockercfg` before that. 

After you have updated the configuration file, restart the ECS service.
