= Resizing Managed Storage

The Quay Operator creates default object storage using the defaults provided by RHOCS when creating a `NooBaa` object (50 Gib).  There are two ways to extend this storage; you can resize an existing PVC or add more PVCs to a new storage pool.

== Resize Noobaa PVC

. Log into the OpenShift console and select `Storage` -> `Persistent Volume Claims`.
. Select the `PersistentVolumeClaim` named like `noobaa-default-backing-store-noobaa-pvc-*`.
. From the Action menu, select `Expand PVC`.
. Enter the new size of the Persistent Volume Claim and select `Expand`.

After a few minutes (depending on the size of the PVC), the expanded size should reflect in the PVC's `Capacity` field.

[NOTE]
====
Expanding CSI volumes is a Technology Preview feature only. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.6/html/storage/expanding-persistent-volumes[].

== Add Another Storage Pool

. Log into the OpenShift console and select `Networking` -> `Routes`.  Make sure the `openshift-storage` project is selected.
. Click on the `Location` field for the `noobaa-mgmt` Route.
. Log into the Noobaa Management Console.
. On the main dashboard, under `Storage Resources`, select `Add Storage Resources`.
. Select `Deploy Kubernetes Pool`
. Enter a new pool name.  Click `Next`.
. Choose the number of Pods to manage the pool and set the size per node.  Click `Next`.
. Click `Deploy`.

After a few minutes, the additional storage pool will be added to the Noobaa resources and available for use by {productname}.
