== {productname} 3.12.6 bug fixes

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-7977[PROJQUAY-7977]. When deploying {productname} with an custom `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` component and then setting the component to `managed: false` in the `QuayRegistry` custom resource definition (CRD), the {productname} Operator continuously terminates and resets the `minReplicas` value to 2 for `mirror` and `clair` components. To work around this issue, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_quay/3/html-single/deploying_the_red_hat_quay_operator_on_openshift_container_platform/index#operator-unmanaged-hpa[Using unmanaged Horizontal Pod Autoscalers].
