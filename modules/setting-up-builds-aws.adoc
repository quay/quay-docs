= {productname} Builder configuration with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud

{productname} can also be configured to use Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances as _build worker_ nodes. This is useful for situations where you might want to have EC2 based _builds_ available as a backup solution in the event that your {ocp} _build workers_ are overloaded or unavailable.

[NOTE]
====
Amazon EC2 _builds_ are not supported by Red{nbsp}Hat. This is currently provided as an upstream feature only.
====

You can follow the steps in "Configuring bare metal builds for {productname-ocp}" and substitute the following changes in your configuration bundle to enable Amazon EC2.

<1> Specifies an AMI name where _builds_ will be run. Unlike bare metal _builds_, these container _builds_ are done directly within an ephemeral EC2 instance. This AMI must utilize ignition and contain a docker. The AMI shown in this example is used by {quay.io} for its build system.
<2> Allows public SSH keys to be added to the build environment for remote troubleshooting access. This key, or keys, should correspond to the private key that an admin or developer will use to SSH into the build worker for debugging purposes. This key can be obtained by establishing an SSH connection to the remote host using a specific SSH key and port. For example: `$ ssh -i /path/to/ssh/key/set/in/ssh_authorized_keys -p 9999 core@localhost`.
