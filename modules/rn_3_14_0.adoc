=== {productname} 3.14.4 new features

The following features have been added with {productname} 3.14.4.

[id="v2-ui-mirroring-tab"]

[id="bug-fixes-314-4"]
=== {productname} 3.14.4 bug fixes

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-9136[PROJQUAY-9136]. Before this update, Alembic migrations failed to install certificates during run, causing issues with {productname} behind HTTPS proxy due to lack of certificates. As a consequence, users experienced migration failure when {productname} was behind an HTTPS proxy. With this release, Alembic migrations no longer require manual certificate installation for {productname} behind HTTPS proxy. As a result, Alembic migrations can now install certs, allowing smooth operation behind HTTPS proxies.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-9156[PROJQUAY-9156]. Previously, some `read-only` permissions were missing for `read-only` superusers. This issue has been resolved.

[id="rn-3-14-3"]
== RHBA-2025:9644 - {productname} 3.14.3 release

Issued 2025-07-01

{productname} release 3.14.3 is now available with Clair {clairproductminv}. The bug fixes that are included in the update are listed in the link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2025:9644[RHBA-2025:9644] advisory.

[id="bug-fixes-314-2"]
=== {productname} 3.14.2 bug fixes

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-8633[PROJQUAY-8633]. Previously, after pushing some image tags to {productname}, selecting the correct date range on the *Tag history* page showed *Invalid date*. This issue has been resolved. 

[id="rn-3-14-1"]
== RHBA-2025:7674 - {productname} 3.14.1 release

Issued 2025-05-15

{productname} release 3.14.1 is now available with Clair {clairproductminv}. The bug fixes that are included in the update are listed in the link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2025:7674[RHBA-2025:7674] advisory.

[id="bug-fixes-314-1"]
=== {productname} 3.14.1 bug fixes

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-8673[PROJQUAY-8673], link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-8680[PROJQUAY-8680], link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-8740[PROJQUAY-8740]. Previously, the v2 UI model card feature did not render tables correctly; additionally, the UI did not display the checkbox in the correct format. With this release, issues with rendering have been resolved.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-8716[PROJQUAY-8716]. Previously, the *Model Card* tab displayed as *ModelCard* on the v2 UI. Now, it correctly displays as *Model Card*.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-8771[PROJQUAY-8771]. With this release, the {productname} Operator supports the customization of the `haproxy.router.openshift.io/timeout` annotation when the `route` component is set to managed (`managed: true`). For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
kind: Route
metadata:
  annotations:
    haproxy.router.openshift.io/timeout: 30m
# ...
----
+
In this example, the timeout value is set to 30 minutes, which allows pushing large image layers.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-5172[PROJQUAY-5172]. With this release, the {productname} Operator now garbage collects unneeded secrets.

[id="documentation-changes-314"]
== {productname} documentation changes

The following documentation changes have been made with the {productname} 3.14 release:

* The {productname} API guide has been updated and split into two books:

** link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/red_hat_quay_api_guide/index[{productname} API guide]. This book contains an overview of the {productname} API, an overview of token types (OAuth 2.0 access tokens, robot account tokens, and OCI referrers OAuth access tokens), how to enable and use the {productname} API, suggestions for token management, and example commands for leveraging API endpoints to execute commands. This book is useful if you are new to the {productname} API or want information about its token types and how to leverage the API.

** link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/red_hat_quay_api_reference/index[{productname} API reference]. This book contains all API reference endpoints and accompanying example commands for those endpoints. This book is useful if you are already familiar with using the {productname} API.

[id="new-features-and-enhancements-314"]
== {productname} new features and enhancements

The following updates have been made to {productname}.

[id="clair-enhancements"]
=== Clair enhancements

* With this release, Clair indexer data is now included with downstream builds. This allows {productname} administrators to more easily reference indexers in the `clair-config.yaml` file when running Clair in an air-gapped or disconnected environment.
+
For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/vulnerability_reporting_with_clair_on_red_hat_quay/index#clair-disconnected-environments[Clair in disconnected environments].

* Clair on {productname} now requires that you update the Clair PostgreSQL database from version 13 to version 15. For more information about this procedure, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/vulnerability_reporting_with_clair_on_red_hat_quay/index#upgrading-clair-postgresql-database[Upgrading the Clair PostgreSQL database].

[id="model-card-rendering"]
=== Model card rendering on the v2 UI

With the release of {productname} 3.14, the v2 UI now renders model card information for machine learning models that include a model card. When a manifest has a certain annotation (for example, `application/x-mlmodel`) and a model card stored as a layer in the manifest, a *Model Card* tab is displayed on the tag's information page. The information on the *Model Card* page provides users with comprehensive insights into each model, and can help enhance a user's understanding of models stored within their registry.

[NOTE]
====
The *Model Card* rendering page is only available on the {productname} v2 UI.
====

To view model card information, {productname} users or administrators must push an artifact to a repository. The artifact must have have an accompanying model card. This information renders under *Repository* -> *<tag_name>* -> *Model Card*.

For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/use_red_hat_quay/index#viewing-model-card-information[Viewing model card information by using the v2 UI].

[id="tag-expiration-enhancement"]
=== Tag expiration enhancement

Previously, when configuring tag expiration for {productname}, the `yearly` option was unavailable on the {productname} v2 UI. With this update, users can now configure default tag expiration to occur yearly on the {productname} v2 UI. This can be set by using the {productname} UI or in your `config.yaml` file. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
DEFAULT_TAG_EXPIRATION: 1y
TAG_EXPIRATION_OPTIONS:
  - 1y
----

[id="new-quay-config-fields-314"]

[id="new-api-endpoints-314"]
== API endpoint enhancements

No new API endpoints were added in {productname} 3.14.

[id="known-issues-and-limitations-314"]
== {productname} {producty} known issues and limitations

The following sections note known issues and limitations for {productname} 3.14.

[id="unsupported-image-types-stuck"]
=== Unsupported image types stuck in querying status

When pushing an unsupported image type, for example, an AI model, to a {productname} registry, the *Security Report* and *Packages* pages on the UI fail to load. This occurs because these image types are stuck in a `Querying` status and, as a result, the pages of these tabs are left blank. This is a known issue and will be fixed in a future version of {productname}.

[id="known-issues-314"]
=== {productname-ocp} multiple ingress controllers known issue

In {ocp} clusters with multiple ingress controllers defined, the {productname} Operator iterates through the list of available ingress controllers are uses the first one that it encounters to determine the cluster hostname. However, the order of ingress controllers in this list is not guaranteed to be consistent across reconciliation cycles. Consequently, the Operator might pick a different ingress controller, leading it to detect a change in the cluster hostname and initiate a new reconciliation process. This can lead to instability in `quay` pods and your {productname-ocp} deployment.

Use one of the following methods to avoid this issue:

* Set the `route` and `tls` components of the `QuayRegistry` resource to be unmanaged (`managed: false`), and create a custom Route for {productname}. For more information about creating a custom Route, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/deploying_the_red_hat_quay_operator_on_openshift_container_platform/index#operator-unmanaged-route[Disabling the Route component].
* Ensure that only one ingress controller matches the {productname} `route` resource, which can be done with ingress controller sharding. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-ver}/html-single/networking/index#nw-ingress-sharding-concept_configuring-ingress-cluster-traffic-ingress-controller[Ingress sharding in {ocp}].

[id="bug-fixes-314"]
== {productname} bug fixes

The following issues were fixed with {productname} 3.14:

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-8532[*PROJQUAY-8532*]. Previously, there was an issue when updating Clair when deployed with Amazon Web Services (AWS) Relational Database Service (RDS) from version 12.19 to 15.7. After upgrading, scanning new images would result images being stuck in a `Queued` state and be unable to procedure a bug report. This issue has been resolved.
* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-8131[*PROJQUAY-8131*]. Previously, users could receive an unknown exception when trying to serialize manifest type for caching on a referrer's endpoint. . This resulted in the following error: `Object of type Manifest is not JSON serializable`. This issue has been resolved.
* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-8272[*PROJQUAY-8272*]. Previously, nested indexes, or intexes referring to another index, were broke in {productname}. This coiuld result in the following response when pushing to a registry: `Error response from registry: recognizable error message not found: PUT "https://quay.io/v2/arewm/oci-spec-1217/manifests/nested-index": response status code 500: Internal Server Error`. This issue has been resolved.
* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-8559[*PROJQUAY-8559*]. Previously, a passport field in NGINX logs was not obfuscated. This issue has been resolved, and the `repeatPassword` value is hidden.

[id="quay-feature-tracker"]
