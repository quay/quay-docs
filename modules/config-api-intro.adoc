= Using the configuration API

The configuration tool exposes 4 endpoints that can be used to build, validate,  bundle and deploy a configuration. The config-tool API is documented at link:https://github.com/quay/config-tool/blob/master/pkg/lib/editor/API.md[]. In this section, you will see how to use the API to retrieve the current configuration and how to validate any changes you make.
