The following image shows the expected design flow and architecture of the enhanced build features:

image:quay-builds-architecture.png[Enhanced Quay builds architecture]

With this enhancement, the build manager first creates the `Job Object`. Then, the `Job Object` then creates a pod using the `quay-builder-image`. The `quay-builder-image` will contain the `quay-builder binary` and the `Podman` service. The created pod runs as `unprivileged`. The `quay-builder binary` then builds the image while communicating status and retrieving build information from the Build Manager.
