= Running {productname} in debug mode

Red Hat recommends gathering your debugging information when opening a support case. Running {productname} in debug mode provides verbose logging to help administrators find more information about various issues. Enabling debug mode can speed up the process to reproduce errors and validate a solution for things like geo-replication deployments, Operator deployments, standalone {productname} deployments, object storage issues, and so on. Additionally, it helps the Red Hat Support to perform a root cause analysis.
