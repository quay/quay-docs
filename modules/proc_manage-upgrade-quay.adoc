[NOTE]
====
We *highly* recommend performing upgrades during a scheduled
maintenance window, as it will require taking the existing cluster down
temporarily. We are working to remove this restriction in a future
release.

== The upgrade process

.  Visit the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/red_hat_quay_release_notes/[Red Hat Quay Release Notes] page and note the latest version of Quay.
.  Shutdown the Quay cluster: Remove *all* containers from
service.
.  On a *single* node, run the newer version of Quay.
.  Quay will perform any necessary database migrations
before bringing itself back into service.

. Watch the logs of the running container to determine when the upgrade
has completed:
+
```
# docker logs -f {containerId}
```
.  Update all other nodes to refer to the new tag and bring them back
into service.
