= Downloading Squashed Docker Images

Docker images are composed of image layers which include all of the
intermediary data used to reach their current state. When iterating on a
solution locally on a developer's machine, layers provide an efficient
workflow.

There are scenarios, however, in which the layers cease to be
efficient. For example, when deploying software to an ephemeral machine,
that machine doesn't care about the whole layer history, it just needs
the end state of the image. This is why Quay.io supports _Squashed
Images_.

== Downloading a Squashed Image

To download a squashed image:

. Navigate to the `Tags` tab of a Quay `Repository View`. For an organization named `abcsales` and a repo named `myweb`,
the URL would be `https://quay.io/repository/abcsales/myweb?tab=tags`) on Quay.io. For a {productname} registry, replace `quay.io` with your registry name.

. On the left
side of the table, click on the _Fetch Tag_ icon for the tag you want
to download. A modal dialog appears with a dropdown for specifying
the desired format of the download.

. Select `Squashed Docker Image` from
the dropdown and then select a robot that has _read_ permission to be
able to pull the repository.

. Click on the `Copy Command` button.
. Paste this command into a shell on the machine where you have
a Docker service running.
. Type `docker images` to see that the image is loaded and read to use.

== Caveats & Warnings

[[prime-the-cache]]
=== Prime the cache!

When the first pull of a squashed image occurs, the registry streams the
image as it is being flattened in real time. Afterwards, the end result
is cached and served directly. Thus, it is recommended to pull the first
squashed image on a developer machine before deploying, so that all of
the production machines can pull the cached result.

[[isnt-piping-curl-insecure]]
=== Isn't piping curl insecure?

You may be familiar with installers that pipe curl into bash
(`curl website.com/installer | /bin/bash`). These scripts are insecure
because they allow arbitrary code execution. The Quay script to download
squashed images uses `curl` to download a tarball that is streamed into
`docker load`. This is just as secure as running `docker pull` because
it never executes anything we've downloaded from the internet.
