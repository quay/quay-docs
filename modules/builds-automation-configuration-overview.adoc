= Builds and Automation

This section outlines the configuration options available for managing automated builds within {productname}. These settings control how Dockerfile builds are triggered, processed, and stored, and how build logs are managed and accessed.

You can use these fields to:

* Enable or disable automated builds from source repositories.
* Configure the behavior and resource management of the build manager.
* Control access to and retention of build logs for auditing or debugging purposes.

These options help you streamline your CI/CD pipeline, enforce build policies, and retain visibility into your build history across the registry.
