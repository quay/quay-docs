To verify that Clair is working correctly on your {productname} deployment, you can pull, tag, and push a sample image to your registry, then view the vulnerability report in the UI.

.Prerequisites

* You have deployed the Clair container image.

.Procedure

. Pull a sample image by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman pull ubuntu:20.04
----

. Tag the image to your registry by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo podman tag docker.io/library/ubuntu:20.04 <quay-server.example.com>/<user-name>/ubuntu:20.04
----

. Push the image to your {productname} registry by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo podman push --tls-verify=false quay-server.example.com/quayadmin/ubuntu:20.04

[NOTE]
====
In some cases, Clair shows duplicate reports on images, for example, `ubi8/nodejs-12` or `ubi8/nodejs-16`. This occurs because vulnerabilities with same name are for different packages. This behavior is expected with Clair vulnerability reporting and will not be addressed as a bug.
