== v2 user interface configuration

With `FEATURE_UI_V2` enabled, you can toggle between the current version of the user interface and the new version of the user interface. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
* This UI is currently in beta and subject to change. In its current state, users can only create, view, and delete organizations, repositories, and image tags. 
* When running {productname} in the old UI, timed-out sessions would require that the user input their password again in the pop-up window. With the new UI, users are returned to the main page and required to input their username and password credentials. This is a known issue and will be fixed in a future version of the new UI. 
* There is a discrepancy in how image manifest sizes are reported between the legacy UI and the new UI. In the legacy UI, image manifests were reported in mebibytes. In the new UI, {productname} uses the standard definition of megabyte (MB) to report image manifest sizes.
