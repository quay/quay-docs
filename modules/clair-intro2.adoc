= Clair Security Scanning

Clair is a set of micro services that can be used with {productname}
to perform vulnerability scanning of container images associated with a set of
Linux operating systems. The micro services design of Clair makes it
appropriate to run in a highly scalable configuration, where
components can be scaled separately as appropriate for enterprise environments.

Clair uses the following vulnerability databases to scan for issues in your images:

* Alpine SecDB database
* AWS UpdateInfo
* Debian Oval database
* Oracle Oval database
* RHEL Oval database
* SUSE Oval database
* Ubuntu Oval database
* Pyup.io (python) database

For information on how Clair does security mapping with the different databases, see
