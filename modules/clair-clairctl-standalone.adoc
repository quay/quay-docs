= Setting up a self-managed deployment of Clair for a disconnected {ocp} cluster

[role="_abstract"]
To install the `clairctl` command line utility for a self-managed Clair deployment on {ocp}, you can copy the tool from a Clair container using podman and set its execution permissions. This lets you use clairctl to manage vulnerability database updates in disconnected environments.

.Procedure

. Install the `clairctl` program for a self-managed Clair deployment by using the `podman cp` command, for example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo podman cp clairv4:/usr/bin/clairctl ./clairctl
----

. Set the permissions of the `clairctl` file so that it can be executed and run by the user, for example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ chmod u+x ./clairctl
----
