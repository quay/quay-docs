= Clair v4 architecture

Clair v4 utilizes the ClairCore library as its engine for examining contents and reporting vulnerabilities. At a high level you can consider Clair a service wrapper to the functionality provided in the ClairCore library. 

== ClairCore 

ClairCore is the engine behind Clair v4's container security solution. The ClairCore package exports our domain models, interfaces necessary to plug into our business logic, and a default set of implementations. This default set of implementations defines our support matrix. 

ClairCore relies on Postgres for its persistence and the library will handle migrations if configured to do so. 

The diagram below is a high level overview of ClairCore's architecture.

When a `claircore.Manifest` is submitted to the LibIndex, the library will index its constituent parts and create a report with its findings. 

When a `claircore.IndexReport` is provided to LibVuln, the library will discover vulnerabilities affecting it and generate a `claircore.Volunerability` report.
