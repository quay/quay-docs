= Location of configuration file in a standalone deployment
For a standalone deployment, the `config.yaml` file must be specified when starting the Quay registry. This file is located in the config volume, so in the following example, the config file is located at `$QUAY/config/config.yaml`:


[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
....
$ sudo podman run -d --rm -p 80:8080 -p 443:8443 \
   --name=quay \
   -v $QUAY/config:/conf/stack:Z \
   -v $QUAY/storage:/datastorage:Z \
   {productrepo}/{quayimage}:{productminv}
....
