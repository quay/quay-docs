//= Differences from Earlier Versions

As of {productname} 3.4.0, the Operator has been completely re-written to provide an improved out of the box experience as well as support for more Day 2 operations.  As a result the new Operator is simpler to use and is more opinionated.  The key differences from earlier versions of the Operator are:

* The `QuayEcosystem` custom resource has been replaced with the `QuayRegistry` custom resource
* The default installation options produces a fully supported Quay environment with all managed dependencies (database, caches, object storage, etc) supported for production use (some components may not be highly available)
* A new robust validation library for Quay's configuration which is shared by the Quay application and config tool for consistency

* Object storage can now be managed by the Operator using the `ObjectBucketClaim` Kubernetes API (Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation can be used to provide a supported implementation of this API on OpenShift)

ifeval::["{productname}" == "Project Quay"]
* Object storage can now be provided by the Operator using the `ObjectBucketClaim` Kubernetes API (e.g. the NooBaa Operator can be from OperatorHub.io can be used to provide an implementation of that API)

* Customization of the container images used by deployed pods for testing and development scenarios
