= Unable to pull mirrored images to {productname} on {ocp}

After mirroring images into the {productname} registry on {ocp} using the `oc adm catalog` mirror command, you might receive the following error when attempting to use that mirrored image: `Failed to pull image "<destination_registry>/<repository>/<image>:<tag>": rpc error: code = Unknown desc = reading manifest 1-191a in <destination_registry>/<repository>/<image>:<tag>: unauthorized: access to the requested resource is not authorized`. This occurs when images are pushed to the {productname} registry without an existing repository. When this happens, a new, private, registry is created automatically. This restrains the kubelet on {ocp} nodes from pulling images and deploying the pod successfully. 

As a workaround to this issue, you can set the `CREATE_PRIVATE_REPO_ON_PUSH` to `false` in your `config.yaml` file. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
CREATE_PRIVATE_REPO_ON_PUSH: false 
----

This helps create a public repository when you first push the image to the {productname} registry when using the `oc adm catalog mirror` command.
