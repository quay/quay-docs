The preceding image shows the expected design flow and architecture of the Quota management feature.

With {productname} 3.7, boxes outlined in black show the current flow, and boxes outlined in green show what need to be implemented to support this feature.

Architecturally, the `RepositorySize` table holds the storage consumption, in bytes, of a {productname} repository within an organization. The sum of all repository sizes for an organization defines the current storage size of a {productname} organization. When an image push is initialized, the user's organization storage is validated to check if it is beyond the configured quota limits. If an image push exceeds defined quota limitations, a soft or hard check occurs. For a soft check, users are notified, and for a hard check, the push is stopped. If storage consumption is within configured quota limits, the push happens as expected.

Image manifest deletion follows a similar flow, wherein the link between associated image tags and the manfiest are deleted. Additionally, after the image manifest is deleted, the repository size is recalculated and updated in the `RepositorySize` table. The image below represents the design flow and architecture when deleting an image manifest:
