= QuayRegistry API

The {productname} Operator provides the `QuayRegistry` custom resource API to declaratively manage `Quay` container registries on the cluster. Use either the {ocp} UI or a command-line tool to interact with this API.

* Creating a `QuayRegistry` results in the {productname} Operator deploying and configuring all necessary resources needed to run {productname} on the cluster.
* Editing a `QuayRegistry` results in the {productname} Operator reconciling the changes and creating, updating, and deleting objects to match the desired configuration.
