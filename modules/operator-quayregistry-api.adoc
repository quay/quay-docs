= QuayRegistry API

The Quay Operator provides the `QuayRegistry` custom resource API to declaratively manage `Quay` container registries on the cluster. Use either the OpenShift UI or a command-line tool to interact with this API.

* Creating a `QuayRegistry` will result in the Operator deploying and configuring all necessary resources needed to run Quay on the cluster.
* Editing a `QuayRegistry` will result in the Operator reconciling the changes and creating/updating/deleting objects to match the desired configuration.
* Deleting a `QuayRegistry` will result in garbage collection of all previously created resources and the `Quay` container registry will no longer be available.
