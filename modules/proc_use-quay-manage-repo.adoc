= Managing access to repositories

As a 
ifeval::["{context}" == "quay-io"]
{quayio}
endif::[]
ifeval::["{context}" == "use-quay"]
{productname}
endif::[]
user, you can create your own repositories and make them accessible to other users that are part of your instance. Alternatively, you can create a specific Organization to allow access to repositories based on defined teams. 

In both User and Organization repositories, you can allow access to those repositories by creating credentials associated with Robot Accounts. Robot Accounts make it easy for a variety of container clients, such as Docker or Podman, to access your repositories without requiring that the client have a 
ifeval::["{context}" == "quay-io"]
{quayio}
endif::[]
ifeval::["{context}" == "use-quay"]
{productname}
endif::[]
user account. 

[id="allow-access-user-repo"]
== Allowing access to user repositories

When you create a repository in a user namespace, you can add access to that repository to user accounts or through Robot Accounts.

[id="allow-user-access-user-repo"]
=== Allowing user access to a user repository

Use the following procedure to allow access to a repository associated with a user account. 

.Procedure 

. Log into 
ifeval::["{context}" == "quay-io"]
{quayio}
endif::[]
ifeval::["{context}" == "use-quay"]
{productname}
endif::[]
with your user account. 

. Select a repository under your user namespace that will be shared across multiple users.

. Select *Settings* in the navigation pane. 

. Type the name of the user to which you want to grant access to your repository. As you type, the name should appear. For example:
+
image:grant-user-access.png[Grant user access to a user repository]

. In the permissions box, select one of the following:
+
  * *Read*. Allows the user to view and pull from the repository. 
  * *Write*. Allows the user to view the repository, pull images from the repository, or push images to the repository.
  * *Admin*. Provides the user with all administrative settings to the repository, as well as all *Read* and *Write* permissions.

. Select the *Add Permission* button. The user now has the assigned permission.

. Optional. You can remove or change user permissions to the repository by selecting the *Options* icon, and then selecting *Delete Permission*. 

[id="allow-robot-access-user-repo"]
=== Allowing robot access to a user repository

Robot Accounts are used to set up automated access to the repositories in
your
ifeval::["{context}" == "quay-io"]
{quayio}
endif::[]
ifeval::["{context}" == "use-quay"]
{productname}
endif::[]
registry. They are similar to {ocp} service accounts.

Setting up a Robot Account results in the following:

* Credentials are generated that are associated with the Robot Account. 

* Repositories and images that the Robot Account can push and pull images from are identified. 

* Generated credentials can be copied and pasted to use with different container clients, such as Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, Mesos, and so on, to access each defined repository. 

Each Robot Account is limited to a single user namespace or Organization. For example, the Robot Account could provide access to all repositories for the user `jsmith`. However, it cannot provide access to repositories that are not in the user's list of repositories. 

Use the following procedure to set up a Robot Account that can allow access to your repositories. 

.Procedure

. On the *Repositories* landing page, click the name of a user. 

. Click *Robot Accounts* on the navigation pane. 

. Click *Create Robot Account*. 

. Provide a name for your Robot Account. 

. Optional. Provide a description for your Robot Account. 

. Click *Create Robot Account*. The name of your Robot Account becomes a combination of your username plus the name of the robot, for example, `jsmith+robot`

. Select the repositories that you want the Robot Account to be associated with. 

. Set the permissions of the Robot Account to one of the following:
+
* *None*. The Robot Account has no permission to the repository.
* *Read*. The Robot Account can view and pull from the repository.
* *Write*. The Robot Account can read (pull) from and write (push) to the repository.
* *Admin*. Full access to pull from, and push to, the repository, plus the ability to do administrative tasks associated with the repository.

. Click the *Add permissions* button to apply the settings. 

. On the *Robot Accounts* page, select the Robot Account to see credential information for that robot. 

. Under the *Robot Account* option, copy the generated token for the robot by clicking *Copy to Clipboard*. To generate a new token, you can click *Regenerate Token*. 
+
[NOTE]
====
Regenerating a token makes any previous tokens for this robot invalid.
====
+
image:robot-gen-token.png[Select Options drop-down to change user passwords]

. Obtain the resulting credentials in the following ways:
+
* *Kubernetes Secret*: Select this to download credentials in the form of a
Kubernetes pull secret yaml file.
* *rkt Configuration*: Select this to download credentials for the rkt
container runtime in the form of a `.json` file.
* *Docker Login*: Select this to copy a full `docker login` command line that
includes the credentials.
* *Docker Configuration*: Select this to download a file to use as a Docker
`config.json` file, to permanently store the credentials on your client system.
* *Mesos Credentials*: Select this to download a tarball that provides the
credentials that can be identified in the URI field of a Mesos configuration
file.

[id="allow-access-org-repo"]
== Organization repositories

After you have created an Organization, you can associate a set of repositories
directly to that Organization. An Organization's repository differs from a basic repository in that the Organization is intended to set up shared repositories through groups of users. In
ifeval::["{context}" == "quay-io"]
{quayio},
endif::[]
ifeval::["{context}" == "use-quay"]
{productname},
endif::[]
groups of users can be either _Teams_, or sets of users with the same permissions, or _individual users_. 

Other useful information about Organizations includes the following:

* You cannot have an Organization embedded within another Organization. To subdivide an
Organization, you use teams.

* Organizations cannot contain users directly. You must first add a team, and then add one or more users to each team.
+
[NOTE]
====
Individual users can be added to specific repositories inside of an organization. Consequently, those users are not members of any team on the *Repository Settings* page. The *Collaborators View* on the *Teams and Memberships* page shows users who have direct access to specific repositories within the organization without needing to be part of that organization specifically.
====

* Teams can be set up in Organizations as just members who use the repositories and
associated images, or as administrators with special privileges for managing
the Organization. 

[id="create-org-repo"]

+
[source,text]
----
{"name":"testorg1"}
----

. Enter the following command to create the new Organization using the API endpoint, passing in your OAuth Access Token and {productname} registry endpoint:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -X POST -k -d @data.json -H "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://<quay-server.example.com>/api/v1/organization/

ifeval::["{context}" == "use-quay"]
{productname}
endif::[]
sends an email to that user. The user remains pending until they accept the invitation. 

Use the following procedure to add users or robot accounts to a team.

.Procedure

. On the *Repository* landing page, click the name of your Organization. 

. In the navigation pane, click *Teams and Membership*. 

. Select the team you want to add users or robot accounts to.

. In the *Team Members* box, enter information for one of the following:
+

+
[NOTE]
====
Robot Accounts are immediately added to the team. For user accounts, an invitation to join is mailed to the user. Until the user accepts that invitation, the user remains in the *INVITED TO JOIN* state. After the user accepts the email invitation to join the team, they move from the *INVITED TO JOIN* list to the *MEMBERS* list for the Organization.
