= Setting default quota

To specify a system-wide default storage quota that is applied to every organization and user, you can use the *DEFAULT_SYSTEM_REJECT_QUOTA_BYTES* configuration flag. 

If you configure a specific quota for an organization or user, and then delete that quota, the system-wide default quota will apply if one has been set. Similarly, if you have configured a specific quota for an organization or user, and then modify the system-wide default quota, the updated system-wide default will override any specific settings.
