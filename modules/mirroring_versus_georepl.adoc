= Repository mirroring versus geo-replication

Quay geo-replication mirrors the entire image storage backend data between 2 or more different storage backends while the database is shared (one Quay registry with two different blob storage endpoints).  The primary use cases for geo-replication are: 

* Speeding up access to the binary blobs for geographically dispersed setups
* Guaranteeing that the image content is the same across regions

Repository mirroring synchronizes selected repositories (or subsets of repositories) from one registry to another. The registries are distinct, with  registry is separate database and image storage. The primary use cases for mirroring are:

* Independent registry deployments in different datacenters or regions, where a certain subset of the overall content is supposed to be shared across the datacenters / regions
* Automatic synchronization or mirroring of selected (whitelisted) upstream repositories from external registries into a local Quay deployment

[Note]
====
Repository mirroring and geo-replication can be used simultaneously.

|===
| Feature / Capability | Geo-replication | Repository mirroring
| What is the feature designed to do? | A shared, global registry | Distinct, different registries
| What happens if replication or mirroring hasnâ€™t been completed yet? | The remote copy is used (slower) | No image is served
| Is access to all storage backends in both regions required? | Yes (all {productname} nodes) | No (distinct storage)
| Can users push images from both sites to the same repository? | Yes | No
| Is all registry content and configuration identical across all regions (shared database) | Yes | No
| Can users select individual namespaces or repositories to be mirrored? | No,by default | Yes
| Can users apply filters to synchronization rules? | No | Yes
