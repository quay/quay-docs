= Repository Mirroring vs. Georeplication

With repository mirroring, you mirror a specific subset of content,
between two or more distinct registries, to
selected datacenters, clusters, or regions. By contrast, Georeplication
provides a single, globally distributed {productname} to serve container
images from localized storage. The two approaches to sharing content
differ in the following ways:

|==================================================================
| Feature / Capability | Georeplication | Repository Mirroring
| What is the feature designed to do? | A shared, global registry | Distinct, different registries
| What happens if replication or mirroring hasn’t been completed yet? | The remote copy is used (slower) | No image is served
| Is access to all storage backends in both regions required? | Yes (all {productname} nodes) | No (distinct storage)
| Can users push images from both sites to the same repository? | Yes | No
| Is all registry content and configuration identical across all regions (shared database) | Yes | No
| Can users select individual namespaces or repositories to be mirrored? | No,by default | Yes
| Can users apply filters to synchronization rules? | No | Yes
