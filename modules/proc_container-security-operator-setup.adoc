= Scan pod images with the Container Security Operator

Using the link:https://operatorhub.io/operator/container-security-operator[Container Security Operator],
(CSO) you can scan container images associated
with active pods, running on OpenShift (4.2 or later) and other Kubernetes
platforms, for known vulnerabilities. The CSO:

* Watches containers associated with pods on all or specified namespaces
* Queries the container registry where the containers came from for vulnerability information provided an imageâ€™s registry supports image scanning (such as a Quay registry with Clair scanning)
* Exposes vulnerabilities via the ImageManifestVuln object in the Kubernetes API

Using the  instructions here, the CSO is installed in the `marketplace-operators` namespace,
so it is available to all namespaces on your OpenShift  cluster.

[NOTE]
====
To see instructions on installing the CSO on Kubernetes,
select the Install button from the link:https://operatorhub.io/operator/container-security-operator[Container Security OperatorHub.io] page.

== Run the CSO in OpenShift

To start using the CSO in OpenShift, do the following:

. Go to Operators -> OperatorHub (select Security) to see the available `Container Security` Operator.

. Select the `Container Security` Operator, then select `Install`
to go to the Create Operator Subscription page.

. Check the settings (all namespaces and automatic approval strategy, by default), and select
`Subscribe`. The `Container Security` appears after a few moments on the `Installed Operators` screen.

. Optionally, you can add custom certificates to the CSO. In this example, create a certificate
named quay.crt in the current directory. Then run the following command to add the cert to the CSO (restart
the Operator pod for the new certs to take effect):
+
```
$ oc create secret generic container-security-operator-extra-certs --from-file=quay.crt -n openshift-operators
```

. Open the OpenShift Dashboard (Home -> Dashboards). A link to
Image Security appears under the status section, with a listing of the number
of vulnerabilities found so far. Select the link to see a Security breakdown, as shown in the following figure:
+

. You can do one of two things at this point to follow up on any detected vulnerabilities:
+
*  Select the link to the vulnerability. You are taken to the container registry, {productname} or other registry
where the container came from, where you can see information about the vulnerability. The following
figure shows an example of detected vulnerabilities from a Quay.io registry:
+
image:cso-registry-vulnerable.png[The CSO points you to a registry containing the vulnerable image]
+
* Select the namespaces link to go to the ImageManifestVuln screen,
where you can see the name of the selected image
and all namespaces where that image is running.
The following figure indicates that a particular vulnerable image
is running in two namespaces:
+
image:cso-namespace-vulnerable.png[View namespaces a vulnerable image is running in]

At this point, you know what images are vulnerable, what
you need to do to fix those vulnerabilities,
and every namespace that the image was run in. So you can:

* Alert anyone running the image that
they need to correct the vulnerability
* Stop the images from running (by deleting the deployment
or other object that started the pod the image is in)

Note that if you do delete the pod, it may take a few minutes
for the vulnerability to reset on the dashboard.

== Query image vulnerabilities from the CLI
You can query information on security from the command line. To query for detected vulnerabilities, type:

```
$ oc get vuln --all-namespaces
NAMESPACE     NAME              AGE
default       sha256.ca90...    6m56s
skynet        sha256.ca90...    9m37s
```
To display details for a particular vulnerability, identify one of the
vulnerabilities, along with its namespace and the `describe` option.
This example shows an active container whose image includes an RPM package with a vulnerability:

```
$ oc describe vuln --namespace mynamespace sha256.ac50e3752...
Name:         sha256.ac50e3752...
Namespace:    quay-enterprise
...
Spec:
  Features:
    Name:            nss-util
    Namespace Name:  centos:7
    Version:         3.44.0-3.el7
    Versionformat:   rpm
    Vulnerabilities:
      Description: Network Security Services (NSS) is a set of libraries...
```
