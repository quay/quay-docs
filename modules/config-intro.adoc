= Getting started with {productname} configuration

{productname} can be deployed by an independent, standalone configuration, or by using the {ocp} {productname} Operator.

How you create, retrieve, update, and validate the {productname} configuration varies depending on the type of deployment you are using. However, the core configuration options are the same for either deployment type. Core configuration can be set by one of the following options:

* Directly, by editing the `config.yaml` file. See "Editing the configuration file" for more information.
* Programmatically, by using the configuration API. See "Using the configuration API" for more information.
* Visually, by using the configuration tool UI.

[NOTE]
====
As of {productname} 3.10, the configuration tool has been removed on {ocp} deployments, meaning that users cannot configure, or reconfigure, directly from the {ocp} console.

As a workaround, you can deploy the configuration tool locally and create your own configuration bundle. This includes entering the database and storage credentials used for your {productname} on {ocp} deployment, generating a `config.yaml` file, and using it to deploy {productname} on {ocp} via the command-line interface.

To deploy the configuration tool locally, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3.10/html-single/deploy_red_hat_quay_for_proof-of-concept_non-production_purposes/index#poc-getting-started[Getting started with {productname}] and follow the instructions up to "Configuring {productname}".
====

For standalone deployments of {productname}, you must supply the minimum required configuration parameters before the registry can be started. The minimum requirements to start a {productname} registry can be found in the "Retrieving the current configuration" section.

If you install {productname} on {ocp} using the {productname} Operator, you do not need to supply configuration parameters because the {productname} Operator supplies default information to deploy the registry.

After you have deployed {productname} with the desired configuration, you should retrieve, and save, the full configuration from your deployment. The full configuration contains additional generated values that you might need when restarting or upgrading your system.
