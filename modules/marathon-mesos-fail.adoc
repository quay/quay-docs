= Pulling private images with Marathon or Mesos fails

When using Marathon or Mesos, attempting to pull an image from a private repository fails with the following error: `msg="Error: Status 403 trying to pull repository repo/project: \"{\\\"error\\\": \\\"Permission Denied\\\"}\""`.

As a workaround, you must copy the Docker configuration file's credentials on to the worker machines. For more information about configuring Mesos registry authentication, see link:https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/native-docker-private-registry.html[Using a Private Docker Registry]. 

When using Mesos app definitions, credentials must be provided as a URI that must be accessible by all nodes that might start your application. Approaches include distributing the file to the local filesystem of all nodes, for example through RSYNC/SCP, or storing it on a shared network drive, for example Amazon S3. It is worth considering the security implications of each approach.

== For deployments using Docker 1.6 or earlier 

Use the following steps to configure Marathon or Mesos for use on private registries with Docker 1.6 or earlier. 

.Procedure 

. Download a configuration from a `Quay.io` credentials dialog, or log in to the private repository manually:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ docker login quay.io
----
+
This create a configuration file in `$HOME/.dockercfg`. 

. Add the `.dockercfg` to the `uris` field of your Mesos app definition. The `$HOME` environment variable must then be set to the same value as `$MESOS_SANDBOX` so that Docker can automatically pick up the configuration file. The following is an example app definition:
+
[source,yaml]
----
{
  "id": "/some/name/or/id",
  "cpus": 1,
  "mem": 1024,
  "instances": 1,
  "container": {
    "type": "DOCKER",
    "docker": {
      "image": "some.docker.host.com/namespace/repo",
      "network": "HOST"
    }
  },
  "uris":  [
      "file:///etc/.dockercfg"
  ]
}
----

[id="deployment-docker-1-6-later"]
== For deployments using Docker 1.6 or later 

Use the following steps to configure Marathon or Mesos for use on private registries with Docker 1.6 or later. 

. Download a configuration from a `Quay.io` credentials dialog, or log in to the private repository manually:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ docker login quay.io
----
+
This create a configuration file in `$HOME/.dockercfg/config.json`.

. `Tar` and `GZIP` the `$HOME/.DOCKER` directory and its contents:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cd $HOME
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ tar czf docker.tar.gz .docker
----

. Enter the following command to ensure that both the directory and the configuration are inside of the `tar`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ tar -tvf $HOME/docker.tar.gz
----
+
.Exampe output
+
[source,terminal]
----
drwx------ root/root         0 2015-07-28 02:54 .docker/
-rw------- root/root       114 2015-07-28 01:31 .docker/config.json
----

. Optional. Put the tarball into a directory readably by Mesos:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cp docker.tar.gz /etc/
----

. Add the file to the `uris` field of your Mesos app definition:
+
[source,yaml]
----
{
  "id": "/some/name/or/id",
  "cpus": 1,
  "mem": 1024,
  "instances": 1,
  "container": {
    "type": "DOCKER",
    "docker": {
      "image": "some.docker.host.com/namespace/repo",
      "network": "HOST"
    }
  },
  "uris":  [
      "file:///etc/docker.tar.gz"
  ]
}
