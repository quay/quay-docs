= Does {productname} support nested LDAP groups for team synchronization? 

{productname} does not currently support nested LDAP team synchronization. As a temporary workaround, you can manually maintain {productname} team membership without using the `directory synchronization` feature, and perform regular syncs of your {productname} team with LDAP group members using cronjobs.
