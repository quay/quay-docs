= Information about Clair updaters

The following table provides details about each Clair updater, including the configuration parameter, a brief description, relevant URLs, and the associated components that they interact with. This list is not exhaustive, and some servers might issue redirects, while certain request URLs are dynamically constructed to ensure accurate vulnerability data retrieval.

For Clair, each updater is responsible for fetching and parsing vulnerability data related to a specific package type or distribution. For example, the Debian updater focuses on Debian-based Linux distributions, while the AWS updater focuses on vulnerabilities specific to Amazon Web Services' Linux distributions. Understanding the package type is important for vulnerability management because different package types might have unique security concerns and require specific updates and patches.

[NOTE]
====
If you are using a proxy server in your environment with Clair's updater URLs, you must identify which URL needs to be added to the proxy allowlist to ensure that Clair can access them unimpeded. Use the following table to add updater URLs to your proxy allowlist.
