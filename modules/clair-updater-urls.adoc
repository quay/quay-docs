[id="clair-updater-urls"]
= Clair updater URLs

The default updaters are tracked in `updater/defaults/defaults.go`.

The following table lists the HTTP hosts and paths that Clair attempts to talk to in a default configuration. This list is non-exhaustive. Some servers issue redirects and some request URLs are constructed dynamically. 

[NOTE]
====
If you are using a proxy server in your environment with Clair's updater URLs, you must identify which URL needs to be added to the proxy allowlist to ensure that Clair can access them unimpeded. For more information, see "Information about using Clair in a proxy environment".
