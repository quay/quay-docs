= Testing SSL configuration using the command line

Use the `podman login` command to attempt to log in to the Quay registry with SSL enabled:

```
$ sudo podman login quay-server.example.com
Username: quayadmin
Password: 

Error: error authenticating creds for "quay-server.example.com": error pinging docker registry quay-server.example.com: Get "https://quay-server.example.com/v2/": x509: certificate signed by unknown authority
```

Podman does not trust self-signed certificates, so as a workaround, you can use the `--tls-verify` option: 

```
$ sudo podman login --tls-verify=false quay-server.example.com
Username: quayadmin
Password: 

Login Succeeded!
```

Configuring Podman to trust the root Certificate Authority (CA) is covered in a subsequent section.
