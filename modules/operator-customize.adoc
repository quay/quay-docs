= Customizing the Quay Deployment

The Quay Operator takes an opinionated strategy towards deploying Quay and its dependencies, however there are places where the Quay deployment can be customized.  

== Quay Application Configuration

Once deployed, the Quay application itself can be configured as normal using the config editor UI or by modifying the `Secret` containing the Quay configuration bundle.  The Operator uses the `Secret` named in the `spec.configBundleSecret` field but does not watch this resource for changes.  It is recommended that configuration changes be made to a new `Secret` resource and the `spec.configBundleSecret` field be updated to reflect the change.  In the event there are issues with the new configuration, it is simple to revert the value of `spec.configBundleSecret` to the older `Secret`.
