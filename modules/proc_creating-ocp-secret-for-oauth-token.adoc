= Creating an {ocp} secret for the OAuth token

The following provide shows you how to store the OAuth 2 access token in a Kubernetes secret so that the {qbo} can communicate with {productname}. This ensures access to perform actions in {productname} without embedding credentials in the custom resource (CR) itself. 

.Prerequisites

* You have set up {productname} and obtained an access token.
* You have deployed the {qbo} on {ocp}.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

* Create a secret that contains the access token in the `openshift-operators` namespace:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create secret -n openshift-operators generic <secret_name> --from-literal=token=<access_token> <1>
----
<1> Specifies the access token generated during "Setting up Red Hat Quay for the Quay Bridge Operator".
