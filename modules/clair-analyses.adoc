= Understanding Clair analyses

Clair analyses can be broken down into three distinct parts: 

- **Indexing**: Indexing starts with submitting a `Manifest` to Clair. On receipt, Clair will fetch layers, scan their contents, and return an intermediate representation called an `IndexReport`. 
+
Manifests are Clair's representation of a container image. Clair leverages the fact `OCI Manifests` and `Layers` are content-addressed to reduce duplicated work. 
+
Once a `Manifest` is indexed, the `IndexReport` is persisted for later retrieval. 

- **Matching**: Matching is taking an `IndexReport` and correlating vulnerabilities affecting the `Manifest` the report represents. 
+
Clair continuously ingests new security data and a request to the matcher will always provide users with the most to date vulnerability analysis of an `IndexReport`. 

- **Notifications**: Clair implements a notification service. When new vulnerabilities are discovered, the notifier service will determine if these vulnerabilities affect any indexed `Manifests`. The notifier will then take action according to its configuration.

== Notifications for vulnerabilities found by Clair

{productname} 3.4 triggers different notifications for various repository events. These notifications vary based on enabled features. 

[NOTE]
====
This include the event type `Package Vulnerability Found`
====

`Additional Filter` can be applied for `Security Level`, and there are various notification methods. Custom notification titles are also optional.
