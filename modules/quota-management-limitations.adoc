= Quota management limitations

Quota management helps organizations maintain resource consumption, however there are a few limitations. For example, calculating resource consumption on push, as opposed to monitoring consumption with a background worker, does not take into account the usage data of existing images. To avoid potential issues, a backfill for all existing repositories is required before the feature is enabled. Additionally, calculation becomes part of a push's critical path, otherwise the usage data could drift.
