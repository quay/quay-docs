= Introduction to repository mirroring in {productname}

{productname} repository mirroring lets you mirror images from external container registries
(or another local registry) into your {productname} cluster.
Using repository mirroring, you can synchronize images to {productname} based on repository names and tags.

From your {productname} cluster with repository mirroring enabled, you can:

* Choose a repository from an external registry to mirror
* Add credentials to access the external registry 
* Identify specific container image repository names and tags to sync
* Set intervals at which a repository is synced
* Check the current state of synchronization


To use the mirroring functionality, you need to:

* Enable Repository Mirroring in the {productname} configuration tool
* Run a repository mirroring worker
* Create mirrored repositories in the {productname} UI
