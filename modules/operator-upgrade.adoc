= Upgrading the Quay Operator Overview

The Quay Operator follows a _synchronized versioning_ scheme, which means that each version of the Operator is tied to the version of Quay and the components that it manages. There is no field on the `QuayRegistry` custom resource which sets the version of Quay to deploy; the Operator only knows how to deploy a single version of all components. This scheme was chosen to ensure that all components work well together and to reduce the complexity of the Operator needing to know how to manage the lifecycles of many different versions of Quay on Kubernetes.

== Operator Lifecycle Manager

The Quay Operator should be installed and upgraded using the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/{producty}/operators/understanding/olm/olm-understanding-olm.html[Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)]. When creating a `Subscription` with the default `approvalStrategy: Automatic`, OLM will automatically upgrade the Quay Operator whenever a new version becomes available.

[WARNING]
====
When the Quay Operator is installed via Operator Lifecycle Manager, it may be configured to support automatic or manual upgrades.  This option is shown on the *Operator Hub* page for the Quay Operator during installation.  It can also be found in the Quay Operator `Subscription` object via the `approvalStrategy` field.  Choosing `Automatic` means that your Quay Operator will automatically be upgraded whenever a new Operator version is released.  If this is not desirable, then the `Manual` approval strategy should be selected.

== Upgrading the Quay Operator

The standard approach for upgrading installed Operators on OpenShift is documented at link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/operators/admin/olm-upgrading-operators.html[Upgrading installed Operators].

In general, {productname} supports upgrades from a prior (N-1) minor version only.  For example, upgrading directly from {productname} 3.0.5 to the latest version of 3.5 is not supported. Instead, users would have to upgrade as follows:

. 3.0.5 -> 3.1.3
. 3.1.3 -> 3.2.2
. 3.2.2 -> 3.3.4
. 3.3.4 -> 3.4.z
. 3.4.z -> 3.5.z

This is required to ensure that any necessary database migrations are done correctly and in the right order during the upgrade.

In some cases, {productname} supports direct, single-step upgrades from prior (N-2, N-3) minor versions. This exception to the normal, prior minor version-only, upgrade simplifies the upgrade procedure for customers on older releases. The following upgrade paths are supported:

. 3.3.z -> 3.6.z
. 3.4.z -> 3.6.z
. 3.4.z -> 3.7.z
. 3.5.z -> 3.7.z

For users on standalone deployments of Quay wanting to upgrade to 3.7, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/upgrade_red_hat_quay/index#standalone_upgrade[Standalone upgrade] guide.


=== Upgrading Quay
To update Quay from one minor version to the next, for example, 3.4 -> 3.5, you need to change the update channel for the Quay Operator.

For `z` stream upgrades, for example, 3.4.2 -> 3.4.3, updates are released in the major-minor channel that the user initially selected during install. The procedure to perform a `z` stream upgrade depends on the `approvalStrategy` as outlined above. If the approval strategy is set to `Automatic`, the Quay Operator will upgrade automatically to the newest `z` stream. This results in automatic, rolling Quay updates to newer `z` streams with little to no downtime. Otherwise, the update must be manually approved before installation can begin.

[[upgrade-33-36]]
=== Notes on upgrading directly from 3.3.z or 3.4.z to 3.6

==== Upgrading with edge routing enabled

* Previously, when running a 3.3.z version of {productname} with edge routing enabled, users were unable to upgrade to 3.4.z versions of {productname}. This has been resolved with the release of {productname} 3.6.

* When upgrading from 3.3.z to 3.6, if `tls.termination` is set to `none` in your {productname} 3.3.z deployment, it will change to HTTPS with TLS edge termination and use the default cluster wildcard certificate. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: quay33
spec:
  quay:
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
    enableRepoMirroring: true
    image: quay.io/quay/quay:v3.3.4-2
    ...
    externalAccess:
      hostname: quayv33.apps.devcluster.openshift.com
      tls:
        termination: none
    database:
...
----

==== Upgrading with custom TLS certificate/key pairs without Subject Alternative Names

There is an issue for customers using their own TLS certificate/key pairs without Subject Alternative Names (SANs) when upgrading from {productname} 3.3.4 to {productname} 3.6 directly. During the upgrade to {productname} 3.6, the deployment is blocked, with the error message from the Quay Operator pod logs indicating that the Quay TLS certificate must have SANs.

If possible, you should regenerate your TLS certificates with the correct hostname in the SANs. A possible workaround involves defining an environment variable in the `quay-app`, `quay-upgrade` and `quay-config-editor` pods after upgrade to enable CommonName matching:

```
 GODEBUG=x509ignoreCN=0
```

The `GODEBUG=x509ignoreCN=0` flag enables the legacy behavior of treating the CommonName field on X.509 certificates as a host name when no SANs are present. However, this workaround is not recommended, as it will not persist across a redeployment.

==== Configuring Clair v4 when upgrading from 3.3.z or 3.4.z to 3.6 using the Quay Operator
To set up Clair v4 on a new {productname} deployment on OpenShift, it is highly recommended to use the Quay Operator. By default, the Quay Operator will install or upgrade a Clair deployment along with your {productname} deployment and configure Clair security scanning automatically.

For instructions on setting up Clair v4 on OpenShift, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/manage_red_hat_quay/index#clair-openshift[Setting Up Clair on a {productname} OpenShift deployment].

=== Changing the update channel for an Operator

The subscription of an installed Operator specifies an update channel, which is used to track and receive updates for the Operator. To upgrade the Quay Operator to start tracking and receiving updates from a newer channel, change the update channel in the *Subscription* tab for the installed Quay Operator. For subscriptions with an `Automatic` approval strategy, the upgrade begins automatically and can be monitored on the page that lists the Installed Operators.

=== Manually approving a pending Operator upgrade

If an installed Operator has the approval strategy in its subscription set to `Manual`, when new updates are released in its current update channel, the update must be manually approved before installation can begin. If the Quay Operator has a pending upgrade, this status will be displayed in the list of Installed Operators. In the `Subscription` tab for the Quay Operator, you can preview the install plan and review the resources that are listed as available for upgrade. If satisfied, click `Approve` and return to the page that lists Installed Operators to monitor the progress of the upgrade.

The following image shows the *Subscription* tab in the UI, including the update `Channel`, the `Approval` strategy, the `Upgrade status` and the `InstallPlan`:

The list of Installed Operators provides a high-level summary of the current Quay installation:

== Upgrading a QuayRegistry

When the Quay Operator starts, it immediately looks for any `QuayRegistries` it can find in the namespace(s) it is configured to watch. When it finds one, the following logic is used:

* If `status.currentVersion` is unset, reconcile as normal.
* If `status.currentVersion` equals the Operator version, reconcile as normal.
* If `status.currentVersion` does not equal the Operator version, check if it can be upgraded. If it can, perform upgrade tasks and set the `status.currentVersion` to the Operator's version once complete. If it cannot be upgraded, return an error and leave the `QuayRegistry` and its deployed Kubernetes objects alone.

== Enabling features in Quay 3.7

=== Quota management configuration

Quota management is now supported under the `FEATURE_QUOTA_MANAGEMENT` property and is turned off by default. To enable quota management, set the feature flag in your `config.yaml` to `true`:

[source,yaml]
----
FEATURE_QUOTA_MANAGEMENT: true
----

=== Using {productname} to proxy a remote organization configuration

Using {productname} to proxy a remote organization is now supported under the `FEATURE_PROXY_CACHE` property. To enable proxy cache, set the feature flag in your `confg.yaml` to `true`:

[source,yaml]
----
FEATURE_PROXY_CACHE: true
----

=== {productname} build enhancements

Builds can be run on virtualized platforms. Backwards compatibility to run previous build configurations are also available. To enable virtual builds, set the feature flag in your `config.yaml` to `true`:

[source,yaml]
----
FEATURE_BUILD_SUPPORT: true
----

=== Geo-replication using the {productname} Operator

Deployments of {productname} with geo-replication is now supported by Operator deployments. To enable geo-replication, set the feature flag in your `config.yaml` to `true`:

[source,yaml]
----
FEATURE_STORAGE_REPLICATION: true
----

== Enabling features in Quay 3.6

=== Console monitoring and alerting

The support for monitoring Quay 3.6 in the OpenShift console requires that the Operator is installed in all namespaces. If you previously installed the Operator in a specific namespace, delete the Operator itself and reinstall it for all namespaces once the upgrade has taken place.

=== OCI and Helm support

Support for Helm and some OCI artifacts is now enabled by default in {productname} 3.6. If you want to explicitly enable the feature, for example, if you are upgrading from a version where it is not enabled by default, you need to reconfigure your Quay deployment to enable the use of OCI artifacts using the following properties:

[source,yaml]
----
FEATURE_GENERAL_OCI_SUPPORT: true
----


== Upgrading a QuayEcosystem

Upgrades are supported from previous versions of the Operator which used the `QuayEcosystem` API for a limited set of configurations. To ensure that migrations do not happen unexpectedly, a special label needs to be applied to the `QuayEcosystem` for it to be migrated. A new `QuayRegistry` will be created for the Operator to manage, but the old `QuayEcosystem` will remain until manually deleted to ensure that you can roll back and still access Quay in case anything goes wrong. To migrate an existing `QuayEcosystem` to a new `QuayRegistry`, follow these steps:

. Add `"quay-operator/migrate": "true"` to the `metadata.labels` of the `QuayEcosystem`.
+
```
$ oc edit quayecosystem <quayecosystemname>
```
+
[source,yaml]
----
metadata:
  labels:
    quay-operator/migrate: "true"
----
. Wait for a `QuayRegistry` to be created with the same `metadata.name` as your `QuayEcosystem`. The `QuayEcosystem` will be marked with the label `"quay-operator/migration-complete": "true"`.

. Once the `status.registryEndpoint` of the new `QuayRegistry` is set, access Quay and confirm all data and settings were migrated successfully.

. When you are confident everything worked correctly, you may delete the `QuayEcosystem` and Kubernetes garbage collection will clean up all old resources.

=== Reverting QuayEcosystem Upgrade

If something goes wrong during the automatic upgrade from `QuayEcosystem` to `QuayRegistry`, follow these steps to revert back to using the `QuayEcosystem`:

. Delete the `QuayRegistry` using either the UI or `kubectl`:
+
```sh
$ kubectl delete -n <namespace> quayregistry <quayecosystem-name>
```

. If external access was provided using a `Route`, change the `Route` to point back to the original `Service` using the UI or `kubectl`.

[NOTE]
====
If your `QuayEcosystem` was managing the Postgres database, the upgrade process will migrate your data to a new Postgres database managed by the upgraded Operator. Your old database will not be changed or removed but Quay will no longer use it once the migration is complete. If there are issues during the data migration, the upgrade process will exit and it is recommended that you continue with your database as an unmanaged component.
====

=== Supported QuayEcosystem Configurations for Upgrades

The Quay Operator will report errors in its logs and in `status.conditions` if migrating a `QuayEcosystem` component fails or is unsupported. All unmanaged components should migrate successfully because no Kubernetes resources need to be adopted and all the necessary values are already provided in Quay's `config.yaml`.

*Database*

Ephemeral database not supported (`volumeSize` field must be set).

*Redis*

Nothing special needed.

*External Access*

Only passthrough `Route` access is supported for automatic migration. Manual migration required for other methods.

* `LoadBalancer` without custom hostname:
After the `QuayEcosystem` is marked with label `"quay-operator/migration-complete": "true"`, delete the `metadata.ownerReferences` field from existing `Service` _before_ deleting the `QuayEcosystem` to prevent Kubernetes from garbage collecting the `Service` and removing the load balancer. A new `Service` will be created with `metadata.name` format `<QuayEcosystem-name>-quay-app`. Edit the `spec.selector` of the existing `Service` to match the `spec.selector` of the new `Service` so traffic to the old load balancer endpoint will now be directed to the new pods. You are now responsible for the old `Service`; the Quay Operator will not manage it.

* `LoadBalancer`/`NodePort`/`Ingress` with custom hostname:
A new `Service` of type `LoadBalancer` will be created with `metadata.name` format `<QuayEcosystem-name>-quay-app`. Change your DNS settings to point to the `status.loadBalancer` endpoint provided by the new `Service`.

*Clair*

Nothing special needed.

*Object Storage*

`QuayEcosystem` did not have a managed object storage component, so object storage will always be marked as unmanaged. Local storage is not supported.

*Repository Mirroring*

Nothing special needed.
