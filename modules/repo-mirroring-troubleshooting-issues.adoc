[id="repo-mirroring-troubleshooting-issues"]
= Troubleshooting repository mirroring 

Use the following sections to troubleshoot repository mirroring for {productname}. 

[id="reviewing-logs-repo-mirroring"]
== Reviewing the logs of your mirrored {productname} instances 

Use the following procedure to review the logs of your mirrored instances. 

.Prerequisites 

* You have enabled debug mode in your {productname} `config.yaml` file. 

.Procedure 

. Retrieve the logs from all running mirror pods. 

.. If you are using the {productname} Operator, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs mirror-pod 
----

.. If you are using a standalone deployment of {productname}, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman logs repomirror-container
----


[id="checking-mirror-configuration"]
== Checking the mirror configuration 

Use the following procedure to review the mirror configuration settings in your {productname} instances. 

.Procedure 

. Review your `config.yaml` settings. 

.. If you are using the {productname} Operator, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc exec -it quay-pod -- cat /conf/stack/config.yaml
----

.. If you are using a standalone deployment of {productname}, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman exec -it quay-container cat /conf/stack/config.yaml 
----

[id="verifying-authentication-permissions"]
== Verifying authentication and permissions 

Ensure that the authentication credentials used for mirroring have the necessary permissions and access rights on both the source and destination {productname} instances. 

On the {productname} UI, check the following settings: 

* The access control settings. Ensure that the user or service account performing the mirroring operation has the required privileges.
* The permissions of your robot account on the {productname} registry. 


[id="manual-copy"]
== Checking slow disk issues 

Repository mirroring uses `skopeo copy` as a background process. Test the time it takes to copy an image by manually running `skopeo copy`. This can help isolate any issues related to specific images or repositories and narrow down the troubleshooting scope. Additionally, it can help identify any network issues or bottlenecks that might be impacting the mirroring performance or causing failures. Pay attention to network latency, packet loss, or any unusual network patterns.

Use the following procedure to time `skopeo copy`. 

.Procedure

* Enter the following command to measure the time it takes to perform `skopeo copy`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ time { skopeo copy docker://SOURCE_REGISTRY_IMAGE docker://DESTINATION_REGISTRY/REPOSITPRY/IMAGE:TAG }
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
