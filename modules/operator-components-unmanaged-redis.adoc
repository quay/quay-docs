= Using an external Redis database

Redis is a critical component that supports several {productname} features, such as build logs and user event tracking. When using an externally managed Redis database with {productname}, you must ensure that it is properly configured and available before deployment. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not share the same Redis instance between {productname} and Clair deployments. Each service must use its own dedicated Redis instance.  
Sharing Redis with other workloads is not supported, because connection-intensive components such as {productname} and Clair can quickly exhaust available Redis connections and degrade performance.
====

////
When managing your own Redis deployment for use with {productname}, the following best practices are recommended:

* **Persistence:** Enable persistence if you want build logs and event data to survive Redis restarts or failures. Non-persistent setups are supported but may result in data loss for transient Redis data.
* **Backups:** Regularly back up your Redis data and configuration. The {productname} Operator does not perform Redis backups.
* **High availability:** For production environments, use a Redis configuration that supports replication or clustering to improve resilience and scalability.
* **Security:** Secure your Redis instance by requiring authentication, using SSL/TLS for connections, and restricting access to trusted clients only.
* **Monitoring:** Monitor memory usage, connection counts, and latency to prevent performance degradation or data loss during peak workloads.
* **Version compatibility:** Use a Redis version supported by your {productname} release. Refer to the {productname} support matrix for compatibility information.
