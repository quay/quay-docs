= Using an external Redis database

[role="_abstract"]
Using an external Redis database with {productname} lets you manage your own Redis infrastructure instead of using the Operator-managed Redis. You must ensure that Redis is properly configured and available before deployment, and use a dedicated instance separate from Clair. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not share the same Redis instance between {productname} and Clair deployments. Each service must use its own dedicated Redis instance.  
Sharing Redis with other workloads is not supported, because connection-intensive components such as {productname} and Clair can quickly exhaust available Redis connections and degrade performance.
