= Editing the configuration file

To deploy a standalone instance of {productname}, you must provide the minimal configuration information. The requirements for a minimal configuration can be found in xref:config-file-minimal[{productname} minimal configuration].

After supplying the required fields, you can validate your configuration. If there are any issues, they will be highlighted. 

[NOTE]
====
It is possible to use the configuration API to validate the configuration, but this requires starting the Quay container in configuration mode. For more information, see xref:config-using-tool[Using the configuration tool]. 
====

For changes to take effect, the registry must be restarted.
