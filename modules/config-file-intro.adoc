= Editing the configuration file

To deploy a standalone instance of {productname}, you must provide the minimal configuration information. The requirements for a minimal configuration can be found in "{productname} minimal configuration."

After supplying the required fields, you can validate your configuration. If there are any issues, they will be highlighted.

[NOTE]
====
It is possible to use the configuration API to validate the configuration, but this requires starting the `Quay` container in configuration mode. 

To deploy the configuration tool locally, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_quay/3.10/html-single/manage_red_hat_quay/index#using-the-config-tool[Using {productname} config tool to modify {productname}].
====

For changes to take effect, the registry must be restarted.
