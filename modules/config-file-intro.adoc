= Editing the configuration file

To deploy a standalone instance of {productname}, you must provide the minimal configuration information. The requirements for a minimal configuration can be found in "{productname} minimal configuration."

After supplying the required fields, you can validate your configuration. If there are any issues, they will be highlighted.

[NOTE]
====
It is possible to use the configuration API to validate the configuration, but this requires starting the `Quay` container in configuration mode. 

To deploy the configuration tool locally, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3.10/html-single/deploy_red_hat_quay_for_proof-of-concept_non-production_purposes/index#poc-getting-started[Getting started with {productname}] and follow the instructions up to "Configuring {productname}".

For changes to take effect, the registry must be restarted.
