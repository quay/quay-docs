= StorageClass

[role="_abstract"]
The {productname} Operator automatically deploys dedicated PostgreSQL databases for both the main Quay registry and the Clair vulnerability scanner. Both of these databases require persistent storage to ensure data integrity and availability.

To enable the Operator to provision this storage seamlessly, your cluster must have a default `StorageClass` configured. The Operator uses this default `StorageClass` to create the Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) required by the Quay and Clair databases. These PVCs ensure that your registry metadata and vulnerability data persist across pod restarts, node failures, and upgrades.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before proceeding with the installation, verify that a default `StorageClass` is configured in your cluster to ensure that the Quay and Clair components can successfully provision their required persistent volumes.
