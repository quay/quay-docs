= Clair indexer configuration fields

The following table describes the configuration fields for Clair's `indexer` component.

[cols="3a,1a,2a",options="header"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description
| **indexer** | Object | Provides Clair indexer node configuration.

| **.airgap** | Boolean | Disables HTTP access to the internet for indexers and fetchers. Private IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are allowed. Database connections are unaffected.

| **.connstring** | String | A Postgres connection string. Accepts format as a URL or libpq connection string.

| **.index_report_request_concurrency** | Integer | Rate limits the number of index report creation requests. Setting this to `0` attemps to auto-size this value. Setting a negative value means unlimited. The auto-sizing is a multiple of the number of available cores.

The API returns a `429` status code if concurrency is exceeded.

| **.scanlock_retry** | Integer | A positive integer representing seconds. Concurrent indexers lock on manifest scans to avoid clobbering. This value tunes how often a waiting indexer polls for the lock.

| **.layer_scan_concurrency** | Integer | Positive integer limiting the number of concurrent layer scans. Indexers will match a manifest's layer concurrently. This value tunes the number of layers an indexer scans in parallel.

| **.migrations** | Boolean | Whether indexer nodes handle migrations to their database.

| **.scanner** | String | Indexer configuration.

Scanner allows for passing configuration options to layer scanners. The scanner will have this configuration pass to it on construction if designed to do so.

| **.scanner.dist** | String | A map with the name of a particular scanner and arbitrary YAML as a value.

| **.scanner.package**  | String | A map with the name of a particular scanner and arbitrary YAML as a value.

| **.scanner.repo** | String | A map with the name of a particular scanner and arbitrary YAML as a value.
