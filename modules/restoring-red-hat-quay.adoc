= Restoring {productname}

[role="_abstract"]
To restore your {productname} registry when the Operator manages the database, you can restore the configuration, database, and object storage from backups. This procedure restores your registry to a previous state after performing the backup process.

[id="prerequisites-for-restoring-red-hat-quay"]
== Prerequisites for restoring {productname}

The following prerequisites are required to restore {productname}:

* {productname} is deployed on {ocp} using the {productname} Operator.
* A backup of the {productname} configuration managed by the {productname} Operator has been created following the instructions in the Backing up {productname} section.
* The object storage bucket used by {productname} has been backed up.
* The components `quay`, `postgres` and `objectstorage` are set to `managed: true`
* If the component `clair` is set to `managed: true`, the component `clairpostgres` is also set to `managed: true`.
* There is no running {productname} deployment managed by the {productname} Operator in the target namespace on your {ocp} cluster

[NOTE]
====
If your deployment contains partially unmanaged database or storage components and you are using external services for PostgreSQL or S3-compatible object storage to run your {productname} deployment, you must refer to the service provider or vendor documentation to restore their data from a backup prior to restore {productname}
