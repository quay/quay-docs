[[clairv2-to-v4]]
= Migrating from Clair v2 to Clair v4 

Starting with {productname} 3.4, Clair v4 will be used by default. It will also be the only version of Clair continually supported, as older {productname} versions are not supported with Clair v4 in production. Users should continue using Clair v2 if using a version of {productname} earlier than 3.4. 

Existing {productname} 3.3 deployments will be upgraded to Clair v4 when managed via the {productname} Operator. Manually upgraded {productname} deployments can install Clair v4 side-by-side, which will cause the following:

* All new image vulnerability scans to be performed by Clair v4
* Existing images to be rescanned by Clair v4
