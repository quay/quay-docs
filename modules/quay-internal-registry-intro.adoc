= Using {productname} with or without internal registry

{productname} can be used as an external registry in front of multiple OpenShift clusters with their internal registries. 

{productname} can also be used in place of using the internal registry when it comes to automating builds and deployment rollouts. The required coordination of `Secrets` and `ImageStreams` is automated by the Quay Bridge Operator, which can be launched from the Operatorhub of OpenShift.
