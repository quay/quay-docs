= Viewing and exporting logs

Activity logs are gathered for all repositories and namespace in
ifeval::["{context}" == "quay-io"]
{quayio}.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{context}" == "use-quay"]
{productname}.
endif::[]

Viewing usage logs of 
ifeval::["{context}" == "quay-io"]
{quayio}.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{context}" == "use-quay"]
{productname}.
endif::[]
can provide valuable insights and benefits for both operational and security purposes. Usage logs might reveal the following information:

* *Resource Planning*: Usage logs can provide data on the number of image pulls, pushes, and overall traffic to your registry.

* *User Activity*: Logs can help you track user activity, showing which users are accessing and interacting with images in the registry. This can be useful for auditing, understanding user behavior, and managing access controls.

* *Usage Patterns*: By studying usage patterns, you can gain insights into which images are popular, which versions are frequently used, and which images are rarely accessed. This information can help prioritize image maintenance and cleanup efforts.

* *Security Auditing*: Usage logs enable you to track who is accessing images and when. This is crucial for security auditing, compliance, and investigating any unauthorized or suspicious activity.

* *Image Lifecycle Management*: Logs can reveal which images are being pulled, pushed, and deleted. This information is essential for managing image lifecycles, including deprecating old images and ensuring that only authorized images are used.

* *Compliance and Regulatory Requirements*: Many industries have compliance requirements that mandate tracking and auditing of access to sensitive resources. Usage logs can help you demonstrate compliance with such regulations.

* *Identifying Abnormal Behavior*: Unusual or abnormal patterns in usage logs can indicate potential security breaches or malicious activity. Monitoring these logs can help you detect and respond to security incidents more effectively.

* *Trend Analysis*: Over time, usage logs can provide trends and insights into how your registry is being used. This can help you make informed decisions about resource allocation, access controls, and image management strategies.

There are multiple ways of accessing log files:

* Viewing logs through the web UI.
* Exporting logs so that they can be saved externally. 
* Accessing log entries using the API. 

To access logs, you must have administrative privileges for the selected repository or namespace. 

[NOTE]
====
A maximum of 100 log results are available at a time via the API.
To gather more results that that, you must use the log exporter feature
described in this chapter.
