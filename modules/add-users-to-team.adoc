= Adding users to a team by using the UI

With administrative privileges to an Organization, you can add users and robot accounts to a team. When you add a user, 
ifeval::["{context}" == "quay-io"]
{quayio}
endif::[]
ifeval::["{context}" == "use-quay"]
{productname}
endif::[]
sends an email to that user. The user remains pending until they accept the invitation. 

Use the following procedure to add users or robot accounts to a team.

.Procedure

. On the {productname} landing page, click the name of your Organization. 

. In the navigation pane, click *Teams and Membership*.

. Select the menu kebab of the team that you want to add users or robot accounts to. Then, click *Manage team members*.

. Click *Add new member*.

. In the textbox, enter information for one of the following:
+
* A username from an account on the registry.
* The email address for a user account on the registry.

[NOTE]
====
Robot Accounts are immediately added to the team. For user accounts, an invitation to join is mailed to the user. Until the user accepts that invitation, the user remains in the *INVITED TO JOIN* state. After the user accepts the email invitation to join the team, they move from the *INVITED TO JOIN* list to the *MEMBERS* list for the Organization.
