[[rn-2-100]]
== Version 2.1.0

Release Date: February 22, 2017

*POSTGRESQL USERS*: This release adds full-text searching capabilities to Quay Enterprise. In order to support this feature, the upgrade migration will attempt to create the `pg_trgm` extension in the database. This operation requires *superuser access* to run, and requires the PostgreSQL Additional Modules to be installed. See https://coreos.com/quay-enterprise/docs/latest/postgres-additional-modules.html to learn how to install the extensions.

Added:

* Full text search support (#2272)
* OIDC support (#2300, #2348)
* API for lookup of security status of a manifest (#2334)
* More descriptive logs (#2358)

Fixed:

* Datetime bug in logs view (#2318)
* Display bug in logs view (#2345)
* Display of expiration date for licenses with multiple entries (#2354)
* V1 search compatibility (#2344)
