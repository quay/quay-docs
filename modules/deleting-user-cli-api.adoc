[IMPORTANT]
====
After deleting the user, any repositories that this user had in his private account become unavailable.
====

.Prerequisites

* You are logged into your {productname} deployment as a superuser.
* You have link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/red_hat_quay_api_guide/index#creating-oauth-access-token[Created an OAuth access token].
* You have set `BROWSER_API_CALLS_XHR_ONLY: false` in your `config.yaml` file.

.Procedure 

. Enter the following link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/red_hat_quay_api_guide/index#deleteinstalluser[`DELETE /api/v1/superuser/users/{username}`] command to delete a user from the command line:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer <insert token here>" https://<quay-server.example.com>/api/v1/superuser/users/<username>

. The CLI does not return information when deleting a user from the CLI. To confirm deletion, you can check the {productname} UI by navigating to *Superuser Admin Panel* -> *Users*, or by entering the following link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/red_hat_quay_api_guide/index#listallusers[`GET /api/v1/superuser/users/`] command. You can then check to see if they are present.

----
$ curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer <bearer_token>" "https://<quay-server.example.com>/api/v1/superuser/users/"
