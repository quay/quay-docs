.Prerequisites

* You are logged into your {productname} deployment as a superuser.
* You have link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html-single/red_hat_quay_api_guide/index#creating-oauth-access-token[Created an OAuth access token].
* You have set `BROWSER_API_CALLS_XHR_ONLY: false` in your `config.yaml` file.

$ curl -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer <insert token here>" https://<quay-server.example.com>/api/v1/superuser/users/<username>

You can then check to see if they are present.
