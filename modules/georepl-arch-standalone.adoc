= Geo-replication using standalone {productname}

In the following image, {productname} is running standalone in two separate regions, with a common database and a common Redis instance. Localized image storage is provided in each region and image pulls are served from the closest available storage engine. Container image pushes are written to the preferred storage engine for the {productname} instance, and will then be replicated, in the background, to the other storage engines.

[NOTE]
====
If Clair fails in one cluster, for example, the US cluster, US users would not see vulnerability reports in {productname} for the second cluster (EU). This is because all Clair instances have the same state. When Clair fails, it is usually because of a problem within the cluster.
