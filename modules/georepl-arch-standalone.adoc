In the example shown above, Quay is running standalone in two separate regions, with a common database and a common Redis instance. Localized image storage is provided in each region and image pulls are served from the closest available storage engine. Container image pushes are written to the preferred storage engine for the Quay instance, and will then be replicated, in the background, to the other storage engines.

[NOTE]
====
In the event that Clair fails in one cluster, for example, the US cluster, US users would not see vulnerability reports in Quay for the second cluster (EU). This is because all Clair instances have the same state. When Clair fails, it is usually because of a problem within the cluster.
