= Deleting a {productname} user 

You can delete a user on the {productname} UI or by using the {productname} API. 

[NOTE]
====
In some cases, when accessing the *Users* tab in the *Superuser Admin Panel* of the {productname} UI, you might encounter a situation where no users are listed. Instead, a message appears, indicating that {productname} is configured to use external authentication, and users can only be created in that system.

This error occurs for one of two reasons: 

* The web UI times out when loading users. When this happens, users are not accessible to perform any operations on. 
* On LDAP authentication. When a userID is changed but the associated email is not. Currently, {productname} does not allow the creation of a new user with an old email address. 

When this happens, you must delete the user using the {productname} API.
