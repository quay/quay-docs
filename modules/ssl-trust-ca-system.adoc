= Configuring the system to trust the certificate authority

Use the following procedure to configure your system to trust the certificate authority. 

.Procedure

. Enter the following command to copy the `rootCA.pem` file to the consolidated system-wide trust store:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo cp rootCA.pem /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
----

. Enter the following command to update the system-wide trust store configuration:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo update-ca-trust extract
----

. Optional. You can use the `trust list` command to ensure that the `Quay` server has been configured:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ trust list | grep quay
    label: quay-server.example.com
----
+
Now, when you browse to the registry at `https://quay-server.example.com`, the lock icon shows that the connection is secure:
+

. To remove the `rootCA.pem` file from system-wide trust, delete the file and update the configuration:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo rm /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/rootCA.pem
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo update-ca-trust extract
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ trust list | grep quay
----
