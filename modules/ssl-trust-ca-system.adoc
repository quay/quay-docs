= Configuring the system to trust the certificate authority

Copy the root CA file to the consolidated system-wide trust store:

```
$ sudo cp rootCA.pem /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
```

Update the system-wide trust store configuration:

```
$ sudo update-ca-trust extract
```

You can use the `trust list` command to ensure that the Quay server has been configured:

```
$ trust list | grep quay
    label: quay-server.example.com
```

Now, when you browse to the registry at `https://quay-server.example.com`, the lock icon shows that the connection is secure:

To remove the root CA from system-wide trust, delete the file and update the configuration:

```
$ sudo rm /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/rootCA.pem
$ sudo update-ca-trust extract
$ trust list | grep quay
$
```
