= Pre-configuration options for automation

{productname} provides configuration options that enable registry administrators to automate early setup tasks and API accessibility. These options are useful for new deployments and controlling how API calls can be made. The following options support automation and administrative control. 

.Automation configuration fields
[cols="2a,1a,3a",options="header"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description| *FEATURE_USER_INITIALIZE* |Boolean | Enables initial user bootstrapping in a newly deployed {productname} registry. When this field is set to `true` in the `config.yaml` file prior to deployment, it allows an administrator to create the first user by calling the `api/v1/user/initialize` endpoint.

[NOTE]
====
Unlike all other registry API calls that require an link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html/red_hat_quay_api_guide/token-overview[OAuth 2 access token] generated by an OAuth application in an existing organization, the `api/v1/user/initialize` endpoint does not require authentication.
====

| *BROWSER_API_CALLS_XHR_ONLY* |Boolean | Controls whether the registry API only accepts calls from browsers. To allow general browser-based access to the API, administrators must set this field to `false`. If set to `true`, API calls are blocked, preventing both administrators and users from interacting with the API.

| *SUPER_USERS* |String | Defines a list of administrative users, or superusers, who have full privileges and unrestricted access to the registry. {productname} administrators should configure `SUPER_USERS` in the `config.yaml` before deployment to ensure immediate administrative access without requiring a redeploy. Setting this field post-deployment requires restarting the registry to take effect.

| *FEATURE_USER_CREATION* |Boolean | Relegates the creation of new users to only superusers when this field is set to `false`. This setting is useful in controlled environments where user access must be provisioned manually by administrators.
