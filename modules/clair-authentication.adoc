= Clair authentication

In its current iteration, Clair v4 (Clair) handles authentication internally.

[NOTE]
====
Previous versions of Clair used JWT Proxy to gate authentication.

Authentication is configured by specifying configuration objects underneath the `auth` key of the configuration. Multiple authentication configurations might be present, but they are used preferentially in the following order:

. PSK. With this authentication configuration, Clair implements JWT-based authentication using a pre-shared key.

. Configuration. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
auth:
  psk:
    key: >-
      MDQ4ODBlNDAtNDc0ZC00MWUxLThhMzAtOTk0MzEwMGQwYTMxCg==
    iss: 'issuer'
----
+
In this configuration the `auth` field requires two parameters: `iss`, which is the issuer to validate all incoming requests, and `key`, which is a base64 coded symmetric key for validating the requests.
