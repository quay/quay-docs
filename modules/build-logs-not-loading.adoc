= Build logs are not loading

In some cases, attempting to load logs for a repository build results in only a throbber icon, and no logs are displayed. This typically occurs when you are using a browser equipped with one of the following extensions: AdBlock, uBlock, or Privacy Badger. These browser extensions can cause the loading of build logs to be cancelled. To resolve this issue, disable the browser extension and reload the page.
