= Quay components

Quay is a powerful container registry platform and as a result, has a significant number of dependencies. These include a database, object storage, Redis, and others. The Quay Operator manages an opinionated deployment of Quay and its dependencies on Kubernetes. These dependencies are treated as _components_ and are configured through the `QuayRegistry` API.

In the `QuayRegistry` custom resource, the `spec.components` field configures components. Each component contains two fields: `kind` - the name of the component, and `managed` - boolean whether the component lifecycle is handled by the Operator. By default (omitting this field), all components are managed and will be autofilled upon reconciliation for visibility:
