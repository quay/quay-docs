= {productname} Operator components

{productname} has a significant number of dependencies. These include a database, object storage, Redis, and others. The {productname} Operator manages an opinionated deployment of {productname} and its dependencies on Kubernetes. These dependencies are treated as _components_ and are configured through the `QuayRegistry` API.

In the `QuayRegistry` custom resource, the `spec.components` field configures components. Each component contains two fields: `kind` (the name of the component), and `managed` (a boolean that addresses whether the component lifecycle is handled by the {productname} Operator). By default, all components are managed and  auto-filled upon reconciliation for visibility:
