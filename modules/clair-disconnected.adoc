= Configuring Clair for Disconnected Environments

Clair utilizes a set of components called Updaters to handle the fetching and parsing of data from various vulnerability databases.  These Updaters are set up by default to pull vulnerability data directly from the internet and work out of the box.  For customers in disconnected environments without direct access to the internet this poses a problem.  Clair supports these environments through the ability to work with different types of update workflows that take into account network isolation.  Using the `clairctl` command line utility, any process can easily fetch Updater data from the internet via an open host, securely transfer the data to an isolated host, and then import the Updater data on the isolated host into Clair itself.

The steps are as follows.

. First ensure that your Clair configuration has disabled automated Updaters from running.
+
.config.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
matcher:
  disable_updaters: true

----

. Export out the latest Updater data to a local archive.  This requires the `clairctl` tool which can be run directly as a binary, or via the Clair container image.  Assuming your Clair configuration is in `/etc/clairv4/config/config.yaml`, to run via the container image:
+
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
```
$ podman run -it --rm -v /etc/clairv4/config:/cfg:Z -v /path/to/output/directory:/updaters:Z --entrypoint /bin/clairctl {productrepo}/{clairimage}:{productminv} --config /cfg/config.yaml export-updaters  /updaters/updaters.gz
```
+
Note that you need to explicitly reference the Clair configuration.  This will create the Updater archive in `/etc/clairv4/updaters/updaters.gz`.  If you want to ensure the archive was created without any errors from the source databases, you can supply the `--strict` flag to `clairctl`.  The archive file should be copied over to a volume that is accessible from the disconnected host running Clair.  From the disconnected host, use the same procedure now to import the archive into Clair.
+
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
```
$ podman run -it --rm -v /etc/clairv4/config:/cfg:Z -v /path/to/output/directory:/updaters:Z --entrypoint /bin/clairctl {productrepo}/{clairimage}:{productminv} --config /cfg/config.yaml import-updaters /updaters/updaters.gz
```
