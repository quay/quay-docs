= Clair in disconnected environments

[role="_abstract"]
Clair supports disconnected environments where your {productname} deployment has no direct internet access. You can use the `clairctl` tool to transfer vulnerability database updates from an open host to your isolated environment, enabling Clair to scan images without internet connectivity.

Clair uses a set of components called _updaters_ to handle the fetching and parsing of data from various vulnerability databases. Updaters are set up by default to pull vulnerability data directly from the internet and work for immediate use.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, Clair enrichment data is CVSS data. Enrichment data is currently unsupported in disconnected environments.
