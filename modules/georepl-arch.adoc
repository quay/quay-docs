In the example shown above, {productname} is running in two separate regions, with a common database and a common Redis instance.

Container image pushes are written to the preferred storage engine for the Quay instance, and will then be replicated, in the background, to the other storage engines. 


The following block diagram shows a possible distribution of resources where {productname} has been deployed on two OpenShift clusters using the Operator:
