= Geo-replication architecture

In the example shown below, Quay is running in two separate regions, with a common database and a common Redis instance. Localized image storage is provided in each region and image pulls will be served by the closest available storage engine. Container image pushes will be written to the preferred storage engine for the Quay instance, and will then be replicated, in the background, to the other storage engines.

The following block diagram shows the distribution of resources where Quay has been deployed on two OpenShift clusters using the Operator:
