= Creating a repository
A repository (also referred to as a namespace) provides a central location
for storing a related set of container images. There are two ways to create
a repository in {productname}: via a push (from `docker` or `podman`) and via
the {productname} UI. These are essentially the same, whether you are
using Quay.io or your own instance of {productname}.

== Creating an image repository via the UI

To create a repository in the {productname} UI under a user account:
. Log in to the user account through the web UI.
. Click the + icon in the top right of the header on the home page (or
other page related to the user) and choose New Repository, as shown in
the following figure:
+
image:repo-create.png[Create a new repository for a user.]

. On the Create New Repository page that appears

  * Add the new repository name to your user name

  * Click Repository Description and type a description of the repository

  * In Repository Visibility, select whether you want the repository to be public or private

  * Click the Create Repository button.

The new repository is created, starting out empty. A docker pull command you
could use to pull an image from this repository (minus the image name) appears
on the screen.

To create a repository in the {productname} UI under an organization:

. Log in as a user that has Admin or Write permission to the organization.
. From the Repositories view, select the organization name from the right
column under Users and Organizations. The page for the organization appears, similar to the page shown in Figure 2.x:
. Click +Create New Repository in the upper-right part of the page.
. On the Create New Repository page that appears:
  * Add the new repository name to the organization name
  * Click Repository Description and type a description of the repository
  * In Repository Visibility, select whether you want the repository to be public or private
  * Click the Create Repository button.

The new repository is created, starting out empty. A docker pull command you could use to
pull an image from this repository (minus the image name) appears on the screen.


[[creating-an-image-repository-via-docker]]
== Creating an image repository via docker or podman

Assuming you have the proper credentials, pushing an image to a repository
that does not yet exist in your {productname} instance will create that
repository as it pushes the image to that repository. Either the `docker` or
`podman` commands will work for these examples.

. Tag the image: With an image available from `docker` or `podman` on your local
system, tag that image with the new repository name and image name. Here are
examples for pushing images to Quay.io or your own {productname} setup (for
example, reg.example.com). For the examples, replace namespace with your
{productname} user name or organization and repo_name with the name of the
repository you want to create:        
+
```
# sudo podman tag myubi-minimal quay.io/namespace/repo_name
# sudo podman tag myubi-standard reg.example.com/namespace/repo_name
```

. Push to the appropriate registry. For example:             
+
```
# sudo podman push quay.io/namespace/repo_name
# sudo podman push reg.example.com/namespace/repo_name
```

[NOTE]
====
To create an application repository, follow the same procedure you did
for creating a container image repository.
