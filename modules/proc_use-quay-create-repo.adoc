= Creating a repository

A repository provides a central location for storing a related set of container images. These images can be used to build applications along with their dependencies in a standardized format.

Repositories are organized by namespaces. Each namespace can have multiple repositories. For example, you might have a namespace for your personal projects, one for your company, or one for a specific team within your organization.

With a paid plan, {quayio}

provides users with access controls for their repositories. Users can make a repository public, meaning that anyone can pull, or download, the images from it, or users can make it private, restricting access to authorized users or teams. 

ifeval::["{context}" == "quay-io"]
[NOTE]
====
The free tier of {quayio} does not allow for private repositories. You must upgrade to a paid tier of {quayio} to create a private repository. For more information, see "Information about {quayio} pricing".

There are two ways to create a repository in 
ifeval::["{context}" == "quay-io"]
{quayio}:

ifeval::["{context}" == "use-quay"]

by pushing an image with the relevant `docker` or `podman` command, or by using the

UI. 

ifeval::["{context}" == "quay-io"]
If you push an image through the command-line interface (CLI) without first creating a repository on the UI, the created repository is set to *Private*, regardless of the plan you have. 

[NOTE]
====
It is recommended that you create a repository on the {quayio} UI before pushing an image. {quayio} checks the plan status and does not allow creation of a private repository if a plan is not active.

UI. 

.Procedure 

. Log in to your user account through the web UI.

. On the

{quayio}

ifeval::["{context}" == "use-quay"]

landing page, click *Create New Repository*. Alternatively, you can click the *+* icon -> *New Repository*. For example:
+
image:repo-create.png[Create a new repository for a user.]

. On the *Create New Repository* page:

.. Append a *Repository Name* to your username or to the Organization that you wish to use. 

.. Optional. Click *Click to set repository description* to add a description of the repository. 

.. Click *Public* or *Private* depending on your needs. 

.. Optional. Select the desired repository initialization. 

. Click *Create Private Repository* to create a new, empty repository.

== Creating an image repository by using the CLI

With the proper credentials, you can _push_ an image to a repository using either Docker or Podman that does not yet exist in your

instance. Pushing an image refers to the process of uploading a container image from your local system or development environment to a container registry like {quayio}. After pushing an image to {quayio}, a repository is created.

Use the following procedure to create an image repository by pushing an image.

.Prerequisites 

* You have download and installed the `podman` CLI. 
* You have logged into {quayio}. 
* You have pulled an image, for example, busybox. 

.Procedure

ifeval::["{context}" == "quay-io"]
. Pull a sample page from an example registry. For example:
+
----
$ podman pull busybox
----
+
.Example output

. Tag the image on your local system with the new repository and image name. For example:
+
ifeval::["{context}" == "quay-io"]
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman tag docker.io/library/busybox quay.io/quayadmin/busybox:test
----
endif::[]
ifeval::["{context}" == "use-quay"]
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo podman tag docker.io/library/busybox quay-server.example.com/quayadmin/busybox:test
----
endif::[]

. Push the image to the registry. Following this step, you can use your browser to see the tagged image in your repository.
