= Prerequisites for {productname} on OpenShift

Here are a few things you need to know before you begin the {productname} Operator on OpenShift deployment:

* *OpenShift cluster*: You need a privileged account to an OpenShift 4.5 or later cluster on which to deploy the {productname} Operator. That account must have the ability to create namespaces at the cluster scope.

* *Object Storage*: By default, the {productname} Operator uses the `ObjectBucketClaim` Kubernetes API to provision object storage. Consuming this API decouples the Operator from any vendor-specific implementation. OpenShift Container Storage provides this API via its NooBaa component, which will be used in this example. Otherwise, {productname} can be manually configured to use any of the following supported cloud storage options:

** Amazon S3 (see link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3680151[S3 IAM Bucket Policy] for details on configuring an S3 bucket policy for {productname})
** Azure Blob Storage
** Google Cloud Storage
** Ceph Object Gateway (RADOS)
** OpenStack Swift
** CloudFront + S3
