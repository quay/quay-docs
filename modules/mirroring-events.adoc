= Event notifications for mirroring

There are three notification events for repository mirroring:

* Repository Mirror Started
* Repository Mirror Success
* Repository Mirror Unsuccessful

The events can be configured inside of the *Settings* tab for each repository, and all existing notification methods such as email, Slack, Quay UI, and webhooks are supported.
