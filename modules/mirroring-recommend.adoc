= Repository mirroring considerations

The following configurations should be considered when deploying repository mirroring: 

* Repository mirroring pods can run on any node including other nodes where {productname} is already running

* Repository mirroring is scheduled in the database and run in batches. As a result, more workers could mean faster mirroring, since more batches will be processed.

* The optimal number of mirroring pods depends on the following: 
** The total number of repositories to be mirrored
** The number of images and tags in the repositories and the frequency of changes 
** Parallel batches

* You should balance your mirroring schedule across all mirrored repositories, so that they do not all start up at the same time.

* For a mid-size deployment with approximately 1000 users and 1000 repositories and roughly 100 mirrored repositories, it is expected that you would use 3-5 mirroring pods, scaling up to 10 if required.
