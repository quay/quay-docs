= Repository mirroring recommendations

* Repository mirroring pods can run on any node including other nodes where Quay is already running
* Repository mirroring is scheduled in the database and run in batches. As a result, more workers could mean faster mirroring, since more batches will be processed.
* The optimal number of mirroring pods depends on: 
** The total number of repositories to be mirrored
** The number of images and tags in the repositories and the frequency of changes 
** Parallel batches
* You should balance your mirroring schedule across all mirrored repositories, so that they do not all start up at the same time.
* For a mid-size deployment, with approximately 1000 users and 1000 repositories, and with roughly 100 mirrored repositories, it is expected that you would use 3-5 mirroring pods, scaling up to 10 if required.
