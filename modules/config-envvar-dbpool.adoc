= Database connection pooling

{productname} is composed of many different processes which all run within the same container. Many of these processes interact with the database.

Database connection pooling is enabled by default, and each process that interacts with the database contains a connection pool. These per-process connection pools are configured to maintain a maximum of 20 connections. Under heavy load, it is possible to fill the connection pool for every process within a {productname} container. Under certain deployments and loads, this might require analysis to ensure that {productname} does not exceed the configured database's maximum connection count.

Overtime, the connection pools release idle connections. To release all connections immediately, {productname} requires a restart.

For standalone {productname} deployments, database connection pooling can be toggled off when starting your deployment. For example:

[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo podman run -d --rm -p 80:8080 -p 443:8443  \
   --name=quay \
   -v $QUAY/config:/conf/stack:Z \
   -v $QUAY/storage:/datastorage:Z \
   -e DB_CONNECTION_POOLING=false
   registry.redhat.io/quay/quay-rhel8:v3.12.1
----

For {productname-ocp}, database connection pooling can be configured by modifying the `QuayRegistry` custom resource definition (CRD). For example:
[source,yaml]
.Example QuayRegistry CRD
----
spec:
  components:
  - kind: quay
    managed: true
    overrides:
      env:
      - name: DB_CONNECTION_POOLING
        value: "false"

.Database connection pooling configuration
[cols="3a,1a,2a",options="header"]
|===
| Variable | Type | Description
| **DB_CONNECTION_POOLING** | String |  Whether to enable or disable database connection pooling. Defaults to true. Accepted values are `"true"` or `"false"`
|===

If database connection pooling is enabled, it is possible to change the maximum size of the connection pool. This can be done through the following `config.yaml` option:

.config.yaml
[source,yaml]

  max_connections: 10
