= Future deprecations

The {productname} v1 UI is scheduled to be formally deprecated in version 3.16.

Deprecation serves as an official notice that the v1 UI will be removed in a future release. Customers should begin planning their transition to the v2 UI. The exact version in which the v1 UI will be completely removed has not yet been determined, but it will be after version 3.16.

The new v2 UI is available for preview and use. We encourage customers to enable the v2 UI to begin exploring the updated interface and workflows in preparation for this transition.

The {productname} v2 UI can be enabled by adding the `FEATURE_UI_V2` field to your `config.yaml` file. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
# ...
FEATURE_UI_V2: true
# ...
----
