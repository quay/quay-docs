= {productname-ocp} builds limitations with self-managed routes

[role="_abstract"]
The {product-title} builds feature has specific networking constraints when using managed routes on {productname-ocp}. Understanding these limitations helps you ensure successful communication between build executors and the build manager.

{ocp} routes are typically restricted to serving traffic to a single port. Because {productname} Builds require gRPC communication, the Operator creates a specific `Route` resource to direct this traffic to the build manager server.

Key considerations for this architecture include:

* **Insecure vs. Secure Traffic:** OpenShift ingress must have HTTP/2 enabled to support the gRPC protocol used by the build manager.
* **Identity and Trust:** The build manager requires the CA certificate of the build cluster to be present in the {productname} configuration to establish a secure connection.
* **Hostname Resolution:** Build jobs must be able to resolve the build manager's hostname. If using a custom subdomain, specific DNS mapping is required to point to the OpenShift router.

See "Configuring {productname} builds for managed routes" for more information.
