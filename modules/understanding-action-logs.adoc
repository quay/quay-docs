= Understanding usage logs

By default, usage logs are stored in the {productname} database. They are exposed through the web UI, on the organization and repository levels, and in the *Superuser Admin Panel*.  

Database logs capture a wide ranges of events in {productname}, such as the changing of account plans, user actions, and general operations. Log entries include information such as the action performed (`kind_id`), the user who performed the action (`account_id` or `performer_id`), the timestamp (`datetime`), and other relevant data associated with the action (`metadata_json`).

== Viewing database logs

The following procedure shows you how to view repository logs that are stored in a PostgreSQL database.

.Prerequisites

* You have administrative privileges.
* You have installed the `psql` CLI tool.

.Procedure

. Enter the following command to log in to your {productname} PostgreSQL database:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ psql -h <quay-server.example.com> -p 5432 -U <user_name> -d <database_name>
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
psql (16.1, server 13.7)
Type "help" for help.
----

. Optional. Enter the following command to display the tables list of your PostgreSQL database:
+
[source,terminal]
----
quay=> \dt
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
                   List of relations
 Schema |            Name            | Type  |  Owner   
--------+----------------------------+-------+----------
 public | logentry                   | table | quayuser
 public | logentry2                  | table | quayuser
 public | logentry3                  | table | quayuser
 public | logentrykind               | table | quayuser
...
----

. You can enter the following command to return a list of `repository_ids` that are required to return log information:
+
[source,terminal]
----
quay=> SELECT id, name FROM repository;
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
 id |        name         
----+---------------------
  3 | new_repository_name
  6 | api-repo
  7 | busybox
...
----

. Enter the following command to use the `logentry3` relation to show log information about one of your repositories:
+
[source,terminal]
----
SELECT * FROM logentry3 WHERE repository_id = <repository_id>;
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
 id | kind_id | account_id | performer_id | repository_id | datetime | ip |    metadata_json
                 
 59 | 14 | 2 | 1 | 6 | 2024-05-13 15:51:01.897189 | 192.168.1.130 | {"repo": "api-repo", "namespace": "test-org"}
----
+
In the above example, the following information is returned:
+
[source,terminal]
----
{
  "log_data": {
    "id": 59 <1>
    "kind_id": "14", <2>
    "account_id": "2", <3>
    "performer_id": "1", <4>
    "repository_id": "6", <5>
    "ip": "192.168.1.100", <6>
    "metadata_json": {"repo": "api-repo", "namespace": "test-org"} <7>
    "datetime": "2024-05-13 15:51:01.897189" <8>
  }
}
----
<1> The unique identifier for the log entry.
<2> The action that was done. In this example, it was `14`. The key, or table, in the following section shows you that this `kind_id` is related to the creation of a repository.
<3> The account that performed the action.
<4> The performer of the action.
<5> The repository that the action was done on. In this example, `6` correlates to the `api-repo` that was discovered in Step 3.
<6> The IP address where the action was performed.
<7> Metadata information, including the name of the repository and its namespace.
<8> The time when the action was performed.
