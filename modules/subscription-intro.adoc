With a {productname} subscription:

* There is no limit on the number of pods (Quay, Clair, Builder, etc.) you can deploy. 
* {productname} pods can run in multiple data centers or availability zones. 
* Storage and database backends can be deployed across multiple data centers or availability zones, but only as a single, shared storage backend and single, shared database backend. 
* {productname} can manage content for an unlimited number of clusters or standalone servers. 
* Clients can access the Quay deployment irrespective of their physical location. 
* You can deploy {productname} on OpenShift infrastructure nodes to minimize subscription requirements.
* You can run the Container Security Operator (CSO) and the Quay Bridge Operator (QBO) on your OpenShift clusters at no additional cost. 

[NOTE]
====
{productname} geo-replication requires a subscription for each storage replication. The database, however, is shared.
