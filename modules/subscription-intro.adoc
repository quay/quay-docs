= {productname} subscription information

{productname} is available with Standard or Premium support, and subscriptions are based on deployments.

[NOTE]
====
Deployment means an installation of a single {productname} registry using a shared data backend.
====

With a {productname} subscription, the following options are available:

* There is no limit on the number of pods, such as Quay, Clair, Builder, and so on, that you can deploy.
* {productname} pods can run in multiple data centers or availability zones.
* Storage and database backends can be deployed across multiple data centers or availability zones, but only as a single, shared storage backend and single, shared database backend.
* {productname} can manage content for an unlimited number of clusters or standalone servers.
* Clients can access the {productname} deployment regardless of their physical location.
* You can deploy {productname} on {ocp} infrastructure nodes to minimize subscription requirements.
* You can run the Container Security Operator (CSO) and the Quay Bridge Operator (QBO) on your {ocp} clusters at no additional cost.

[NOTE]
====
{productname} geo-replication requires a subscription for each storage replication. The database, however, is shared.
