= Architecture

{productname} is made up of several core components.

* **Database**: Used by {productname} as its primary metadata storage (not for image storage).
* **Redis (key, value store)**: Stores live builder logs and the {productname} tutorial.
* **Quay (container registry)**: Runs the quay container as a service, consisting of several components in the pod.
* **Clair**: Scans container images for vulnerabilities and suggests fixes.

For supported deployments, you need to use one of the following types of storage:

* **Public cloud storage**: In public cloud environments, you should use the cloud provider's object storage, such as Amazon S3 (for AWS) or Google Cloud Storage (for Google Cloud).

* **Private cloud storage**: In private clouds, an S3 or Swift compliant Object Store is needed, such as Ceph RADOS, or OpenStack Swift.

Do not use "Locally mounted directory" Storage Engine for any production configurations. Mounted NFS volumes are not supported. Local storage is meant for {productname} test-only installations.
