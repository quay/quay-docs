== Architecture

{productname} consists of a number of core components, both internal and external.


=== Internal components

* **Quay (container registry)**: Runs the quay container as a service, consisting of several components in the pod.
* **Clair**: Scans container images for vulnerabilities and suggests fixes.

=== External components

* **Database**: Used by {productname} as its primary metadata storage (not for image storage).
* **Redis (key-value store)**: Stores live builder logs and the {productname} tutorial.
* **Cloud storage**:For supported deployments, you need to use one of the following types of storage:
** **Public cloud storage**: In public cloud environments, you should use the cloud provider's object storage, such as Amazon S3 (for AWS) or Google Cloud Storage (for Google Cloud).
** **Private cloud storage**: In private clouds, an S3 or Swift compliant Object Store is needed, such as Ceph RADOS, or OpenStack Swift.
