[id="poc-internal-components"]
=== Internal components

{productname} includes the following internal components:

* **Quay (container registry)**. Runs the `Quay` container as a service, consisting of several components in the pod.
* **Clair**. Scans container images for vulnerabilities and suggests fixes.

[id="poc-external-components"]
=== External components

{productname} includes the following external components:

* **Database**. Used by {productname} as its primary metadata storage. Note that this is not for image storage.
* **Redis (key-value store)**. Stores live builder logs and the {productname} tutorial. Also includes the locking mechanism that is required for garbage collection.
* **Cloud storage**. For supported deployments, one of the following storage types must be used:
** **Public cloud storage**. In public cloud environments, you should use the cloud provider's object storage, such as Amazon Web Services's Amazon S3 or Google Cloud's Google Cloud Storage.
** **Private cloud storage**. In private clouds, an S3 or Swift compliant Object Store is needed, such as Ceph RADOS, or OpenStack Swift.

[WARNING]
====
Do not use "Locally mounted directory" Storage Engine for any production configurations. Mounted NFS volumes are not supported. Local storage is meant for {productname} test-only installations.
