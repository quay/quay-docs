= Required configuration fields

{productname} requires a minimal set of configuration fields to operator correctly. These fields define essential aspects of your deployment, such as how the registry is accessed, where image content is stored, how metadata is persisted, and how background services such as logs are managed.

The required configuration fields fall into five main categories:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/configure_red_hat_quay/index#config-fields-required-general[*General required fields*]. Core fields such as the authentication type, URL scheme, server hostname, database secret key, and secret key are covered in this section.

* link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/configure_red_hat_quay/index#config-fields-storage[*Storage for images*]. Storage fields define the backend where container image blogs and manifests are stored. Your storage backend must be supported by {productname}, such as Ceph/RadosGW, OpenShift Container Storage/NooBaa, AWS S3 storage, and so on.

* link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/configure_red_hat_quay/index#config-fields-db[*Database for metadata*]. {productname} requires a PostgreSQL relational database to store metadata about repositories, users, teams, and tags. 

* link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/configure_red_hat_quay/index#config-fields-redis[*Redis for build logs and user events*]. Redis is used as a backend for data such as push logs, user notifications, and other operations.
