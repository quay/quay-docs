= Automating {productname} processes by using the API

With the API, {productname} administrators and users with access to the API can automate repetitive tasks such as repository management or image pruning. 

The following example shows you how you might use a Python script and a cron job to automate the deletion of OAuth 2 applications _except_ the administrator's token. This might be useful if you want to ensure an application associated with an OAuth 2 access token is cycled after a certain period of time.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the {productname} API, which entails having already created an OAuth 2 access token.
* You have set `BROWSER_API_CALLS_XHR_ONLY: false` in your `config.yaml` file.
* You have installed the Python `requests` library using.
* You have enabled cron jobs on your machine.
* You have created several organization applications, including one that will not be deleted.

.Procedure

. Create a Python script that executes an API command. The following example is used to prune images using the link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/red_hat_quay_api_guide/index#deletefulltag[`DELETE /api/v1/repository/{repository}/tag/{tag}`] API endpoint.

----
<1> Includes the `import` library in your Python code.
<2> The URL of your registry appended with `/api/v1`.
<3> Your OAuth 2 access token.
<4> The organization that holds the application.
<5> The name of the application token to remain.

. Save the script as `prune_applications.py`.

. Create a cron job that automatically runs the script:

.. Open the crontab editor by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ crontab -e
----

.. In the editor, add the cron job for running the script. The following example runs the script once per month:

[source,text]

0 0 1 * * sudo python /path/to/prune_images.py >> /var/log/prune_images.log 2>&1
