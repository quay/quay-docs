= Customizing Default Operator Images

[NOTE]
====
Currently, customizing default Operator images is not supported on IBM Power and IBM Z.

[role="_abstract"]
Customizing default Operator images lets you override the default container images used by the {productname} Operator by setting environment variables in the `ClusterServiceVersion` object.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Customizing default Operator images is not supported for production {productname} environments and is only recommended for development or testing purposes. There is no guarantee your deployment will work correctly when using non-default images with the {productname} Operator.
