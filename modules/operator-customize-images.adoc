= Customizing Default Operator Images

In certain circumstances, it might be useful to override the default images used by the {productname} Operator. This can be done by setting one or more environment variables in the {productname} Operator `ClusterServiceVersion`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Using this mechanism is not supported for production {productname} environments and is strongly encouraged only for development or testing purposes. There is no guarantee your deployment will work correctly when using non-default images with the {productname} Operator.
====

[id="custom-environment-variables"]
== Environment Variables

The following environment variables are used in the {productname} Operator to override component images:

[cols=2*]
|===
|Environment Variable
|Component

|`RELATED_IMAGE_COMPONENT_QUAY`
|`base`

|`RELATED_IMAGE_COMPONENT_CLAIR`
|`clair`

|`RELATED_IMAGE_COMPONENT_POSTGRES`
|`postgres` and `clair` databases

|`RELATED_IMAGE_COMPONENT_REDIS`
|`redis`
|===

[NOTE]
====
Overridden images *must* be referenced by manifest (@sha256:) and not by tag (:latest).

[id="applying-overrides-to-running-operator"]
== Applying overrides to a running Operator

When the {productname} Operator is installed in a cluster through the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/{ocp-y}/operators/understanding/olm/olm-understanding-olm.html[Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)], the managed component container images can be easily overridden by modifying the `ClusterServiceVersion` object.

Use the following procedure to apply overrides to a running {productname} Operator.

.Procedure

. The `ClusterServiceVersion` object is Operator Lifecycle Manager's representation of a running Operator in the cluster. Find the {productname} Operator's `ClusterServiceVersion` by using a Kubernetes UI or the `kubectl`/`oc` CLI tool. For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get clusterserviceversions -n <your-namespace>
----

. Using the UI, `oc edit`, or another method, modify the {productname} `ClusterServiceVersion` to include the environment variables outlined above to point to the override images:
+
*JSONPath*: `spec.install.spec.deployments[0].spec.template.spec.containers[0].env`
+
[source,yaml]

[NOTE]
====
This is done at the Operator level, so every `QuayRegistry` will be deployed using these same overrides.
