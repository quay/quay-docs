[[config-fields-quota]]
= Quota management configuration

Quota management is now supported under the `FEATURE_QUOTA_MANAGEMENT` property. Quota management is turned off by default, so to enable it, set the feature flag in your `config.yaml` to `true`:

[source,yaml]
----
FEATURE_QUOTA_MANAGEMENT: true

[NOTE]
====
In {productname} 3.7, superuser privileges are required to create, update and delete quotas.
