= Unable to reach registry endpoint

In some cases, trying to pull a Docker image returns the following error: `Could not reach any registry endpoint`. This usually occurs because you are attempting to pull a non-existent tag. If you do not specify a tag, newer version of Docker attempt to pull the "latest" tag, regardless of whether it actually exists.
