[[rn-2-902]]
== Version 2.9.2
Release Date: May 16, 2018

[NOTE]
====
This release fixes a bug in which the deletion of namespaces did not result in the deletion of robot accounts under that namespace. While this is not a security issue (no permissions or credentials are leaked), it can appear unusual to users, so an upgrade is highly recommended. This change also includes a migration that cleans up the aforementioned robot accounts, so the migration step can take several minutes. Please plan accordingly.
