= Deploying the {productname} registry by using the {ocp} web console

[role="_abstract"]
Use the {ocp} web console to create and deploy a basic {productname} registry instance.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {productname} Operator.
* You have have administrative privileges to the cluster.

.Procedure 

. On the {ocp} web console, click *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* -> *Red Hat Quay*.

. On the *Red Hat Quay* dashboard, click *Create instance*. 

. On the *Create QuayRegistry* page, review the default settings of the `QuayRegistry` custom resource (CR). Here, you decide whether to to use managed or unmanaged object storage.

.. If you are using the Multicloud Object Gateway or {odf} as your object storage, keep the following settings:
+
[source,yaml]
----
    - kind: objectstorage
      managed: true
----

.. If you are using a different storage provider, such as Google Cloud Platform, AWS S3, or Nutanix, set the `objectstorage` component as follows:
+
[source,yaml]
----
    - kind: objectstorage
      managed: false
----

. Click *Create*. You are redirected to the *Quay Registry* tab on the Operator page.

. Click the name of the {productname} registry that you created, then click *Events* to view the status of creation. If you used managed storage and leveraged the Multicloud Object Gateway, the registry completes creation. If you are using {odf} or an unmanaged storage backend provider, complete the following steps:

.. Click the *Details* page of the {productname} registry.

.. Click the name of the *Config Bundle Secret* resource, for example, *<example_registry_name_config-bundle-secret-12345>*.

.. Click *Actions* -> *Edit Secret*, and pass in the following information from your backend storage provider:
+
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
DISTRIBUTED_STORAGE_CONFIG:
    <storage_provider>:
        - <storage_provider_name>
        - access_key: <access_key>
          bucket_name: <bucket_name>
          secret_key: <secret_key>
          storage_path: /datastorage/registry
# ...
----
