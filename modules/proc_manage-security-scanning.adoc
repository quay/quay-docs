= {productname} Security Scanning with Clair V2

{productname} supports scanning container images for known
vulnerabilities with a scanning engine such as link:https://github.com/coreos/clair/[Clair].
This document explains how to configure Clair with {productname}.

[NOTE]
====
With the release of {productname} 3.4, the default version of Clair is V4.  This new version V4 is no longer being released as link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview] and is supported for production use.  Customers are strongly encouraged to use Clair V4 for with {productname} 3.4.  It is possible to run both Clair V4 and Clair V2 simultaneously if so desired.  In future versions of {productname}, Clair V2 will eventually be removed.
====

== Set up Clair V2 in the {productname} config tool
Enabling Clair V2 in {productname} consists of:

* Starting the {productname} config tool. See the {productname} deployment guide
for the type of deployment you are doing (OpenShift, Basic, or HA) for how to
start the config tool for that environment.
* Enabling security scanning, then generating a private key and PEM file in the config tool
* Including the key and PEM file in the Clair config file
* Start the Clair container

The procedure varies, based on whether you are running {productname} on OpenShift or directly on a host.

=== Enabling Clair V2 on a {productname} OpenShift deployment
To set up Clair V2 on {productname} in OpenShift, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/deploy_red_hat_quay_on_openshift/index#add-clair-scanner[Add Clair image scanning to {productname}].

=== Enabling Clair V2 on a {productname} Basic or HA deployment
To set up Clair V2 on a {productname} deployment where the container is running directly on the host system, do the following:

. **Restart the {productname} config tool**: Run the `Quay` container again in config mode,
open the configuration UI in a browser, then select `Modify an existing configuration`.
When prompted, upload the `quay-config.tar.gz` file that was originally created for the deployment.

. **Enable Security Scanning**: Scroll to the Security Scanner section and
select the "Enable Security Scanning" checkbox. From the fields that appear you need to create an
authentication key and enter the security scanner endpoint. Here's how:
+
* **Generate key**: Click `Create Key`, then from the pop-up window
type a name for the Clair private key
and an optional expiration date (if blank, the key
never expires). Then select Generate Key.
* **Copy the Clair key and PEM file**: Save the Key ID (to a notepad or similar)
and download a copy of the Private Key PEM file (`named security_scanner.pem`)
by selecting "Download Private Key"
(if you lose the key, you need to generate a new one). You will need the key and PEM file when you
start the Clair container later.
+
Close the pop-up when you are done.
Here is an example of a completed Security Scanner config:

. **Save the configuration**: Click `Save Configuration Changes` and then select `Download Configuration`
to save it to your local system.
. **Deploy the configuration**: To pick up the changes enabling scanning, as well as other
changes you may have made to the configuration, unpack the `quay-config.tar.gz` and copy the resulting
files to the config directory. For example:
+
....
$ tar xvf quay-config.tar.gz
config.yaml  ssl.cert  ssl.key
$ cp config.yaml ssl* /mnt/quay/config
....

Next, start the Clair V2 container and associated database, as described in the following sections.
