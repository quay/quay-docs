= Can I increase LDAP timeouts when accessing {productname}? 

When using LDAP as your authentication provider, some users might experience timeouts when accessing {productname}. You can increase the timeout value by adding the following properties to your `config.yaml` file:

[source,yaml]
----
LDAP_TIMEOUT: 60
LDAP_NETWORK_TIMEOUT: 60
----

This increases the timeout to 60 seconds. The default time for this field is 10 seconds. 

If you are using a standalone version of {productname}, redeploy {productname} after updating your `config.yaml` file. 

If you are using the {productname} Operator, update the `config-bundle-secret` with the latest configuration.
