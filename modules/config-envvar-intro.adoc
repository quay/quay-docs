= Environment variable configuration

{productname} supports a limited set of environment variables that control runtime behavior and performance tuning. These values provide flexibility in specific scenarios where per-process behavior, connection counts, or regional configuration must be adjusted dynamically.

Use environment variables cautiously. These options typically override or augment existing configuration mechanisms.

This section documents environment variables related to the following components:

- Geo-replication preferences
- Database connection pooling
- HTTP connection concurrency
- Worker process scaling
