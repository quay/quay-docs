== RHBA-2022:6353 - {productname} 3.7.8 bug fix update

Issued: 2022-09-12

{productname} release 3.7.8 is now available. The bug fixes that are included in the update are listed in the link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2022:6353[RHBA-2022:6353] advisory.

=== Bug fixes

== RHBA-2022:6154 - {productname} 3.7.7 bug fix update

Issued: 2022-08-31

{productname} release 3.7.7 is now available. The bug fixes that are included in the update are listed in the link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2022:6154[RHBA-2022:6154] advisory.

=== New features 

* With this update, the `REPO_MIRROR_ROLLBACK` configuration field has been added. When this field is set to `true`, the repository rolls back after a failed mirror attempt. By default, this field is set to `false`. 

=== Bug fixes

* Previously, users could only mirror and replicate the entirety of their upstream repository. When complex expressions for tag discovery were used, a list of several tags to be mirrored was created. If the mirroring process failed for any tag failed at any point during the replication procedure, {productname} would revert the repository to its previous state. If the mirrored repository was empty, all tags that were correctly mirrored were deleted. For example, if you mirrored 10 tags, and 8 tags were mirrored successfully, but 2 failed, all of the successful tags would be deleted from the repository because of the 2 that failed.   
+
With this update, if a mirroring operation fails, it will no longer roll back the state of the repository. Instead, it will log the images that failed to properly mirror. 
+
For users who want their repository rolled back upon failure, the `REPO_MIRROR_ROLLBACK` feature has been added. When the feature is set to `true`, the repository rolls back after a failed mirror attempt. By default, the feature is set to `false`. 
+

[[rn-3-700]]
== Version 3.7.0

=== quay / clair / quay-builder

Added/Changed:

* Image APIs are now deprecated. Users should move to manifest-based APIs. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-3418[PROJQUAY-3418])

* With {productname} 3.7, users have the ability to report storage consumption and to contain registry growth by establishing configured storage quota limits. With this feature, organizations can easily avoid exceeding storage limitations by rejecting pulls at a specified limit. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-302[PROJQUAY-302], link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-253[PROJQUAY-253])

* The bare-metal constraint required to run builds has been removed by adding an additional build option which does not contain the virtual machine layer. As a result, builds can be run on virtualized platforms. Backwards compatibility to run previous build configurations are also available. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-295[PROJQUAY-295])

* {productname} can now act as a proxy cache to mitigate pull-rate limitations from upstream registries. This feature also accelerates pull performance, because images are pulled from the cache rather than upstream dependencies. Cached images are only updated when the upstream image digest differs from the cached image, reducing rate limitations and potential throttling. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-465[PROJQUAY-465])

* Support for Microsoft Azure Government (MAG) has been added. This optional feature allows government agencies and public sector customers to select and specify a MAG endpoint in their Azure storage yaml. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-891[PROJQUAY-891])

* Introduced in {productname} 3.6, Java scanning for Clair 4.2, which requires CRDA, included a default shared CRDA key and was enabled by default. Additionally, the default CRDA configuration supported low RPS. With {productname} 3.7, Java scanning no longer includes a default CRDA shared key, and is no longer enabled by default. Users must now manually enable CRDA for scan results, and enable it in Clair's configuration. To enable CRDA, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3.7/html-single/manage_red_hat_quay#clair_crda_configuration[Clair CRDA configuration].
+
[NOTE]
====
This feature is currently denoted as `Technology Preview`.
====

* {productname} now accepts unsigned images. This feature can be enabled under an organization's *Repository Mirroring* page. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-3106[PROJQUAY-3106])

Known issues:

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-3590[PROJQUAY-3590]. Quay 3.7.0 pull from cache should return quota exceeded error rather than general 403 error code.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-3767[PROJQUAY-3767]. Quota for _user_ accounts cannot be reconfigured using the {productname} UI.

Fixed:

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-3648[PROJQUAY-3648]. OAuth2 code flow: Missing state parameters when user is asked to authorize.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-2495[PROJQUAY-2495]. Gitlab validation fails on Quay 3.5.6.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-2560[PROJQUAY-2560]. The Quay Config Tool is not validating configurations for Github Enterprise Login.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-3656[PROJQUAY-3656]. Could not verify GitHub OAuth credentials.

=== quay-operator

Added/Changed:

* Advanced Clair configuration is now available for {productname} 3.7. The following features are now available to Quay administrators on the Quay Operator:

** Configuration of Clair's updater set through the Quay Operator.
** Configuration of the database connection string through the Quay Operator.
** Configuration of custom certificates into the Clair deployment, which allows support of internal HTTPS proxies.
** Support for alternative fully qualified domain names (FQDN) for Clair that can leverage a global load balancing mechanism fronting different clusters running Clair.
+
For more information, see link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-2110[PROJQUAY-2210].

* With advanced Clair configuration, users can also provide a custom Clair configuration for an unmanaged Clair database on the {productname} Operator. An unmanaged Clair database allows the {productname} Operator to work in a Geo-Replicated environment, where multiple instances of the Operator must communicate with the same database. An unmanaged Clair database can also be used when a user requires a highly-available (HA) Clair database that exists outside of a cluster. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-1696[PROJQUAY-1969])

* Geo-replication is now available with the {productname} Operator. This feature allows multiple, geographically distributed Quay deployments to work as a single registry from the perspective of a client or user. It significantly improves push and pull performance in a globally-distributed Quay setup. Image data is asynchronously replicated in the background with transparent failover / redirect for clients. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-2504[PROJQUAY-2504])

* With {productname} 3.7, reconfiguring Quay through the UI no longer generates a new login password. The password now generates only once, and remains the same after reconciling `QuayRegistry` objects. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-3318[PROJQUAY-3318])
