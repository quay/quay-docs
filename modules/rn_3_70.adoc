[[rn-3-700]]
== Version 3.7.0

=== quay / clair / quay-builder

Added/Changed:

* With {productname} 3.7, users have the ability to report storage consumption and to contain registry growth by establishing configured storage quota limits. With this feature, organizations can easily avoid exceeding storage limitations by rejecting pulls at a specified limit. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-302[PROJQUAY-302], link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-253[PROJQUAY-253])

* The bare-metal constraint required to run builds has been removed by adding an additional build option which does not contain the virtual machine layer. As a result, builds can be run on virtualized platforms. Backwards compatibility to run previous build configurations are also available. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-295[PROJQUAY-295])

* {productname} can now act as a proxy cache to mitigate pull-rate limitations from upstream registries. This feature also accelerates pull performance, because images are pulled from the cache rather than upstream dependencies. Cached images are only updated when the upstream image digest differs from the cached image, reducing rate limitations and potential throttling. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-465[PROJQUAY-465])

* Support for Microsoft Azure Government (MAG) has been added. This optional feature allows government agencies and public sector customers to select and specify a MAG endpoint. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-891[PROJQUAY-891])

Known issues:

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-3590[PROJQUAY-3590]. Quay 3.7.0 pull from cache should return quota exceeded error rather than general 403 error code.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-3767[PROJQUAY-3767]. Quota for _user_ accounts cannot be reconfigured using the {productname} UI.

Fixed:

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-3648[PROJQUAY-3648]. OAuth2 code flow: Missing state parameters when user is asked to authorize.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-2495[PROJQUAY-2495]. Gitlab validation fails on Quay 3.5.6.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-2560[PROJQUAY-2560]. The Quay Config Tool is not validating configurations for Github Enterprise Login.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-3656[PROJQUAY-3656]. Could not verify GitHub OAuth credentials.

=== quay-operator

Added/Changed:

* Advanced Clair configuration is now available for {productname} 3.7. The following features are now available to Quay administrators on the Quay Operator:

** Configuration of Clair's updater set through the Quay Operator.
** Configuration of the database connection string through the Quay Operator.
** Configuration of custom certificates into the Clair deployment, which allows support of internal HTTPS proxies.
** Override, or re-size, the size and storage class of the Postgres Database PVC.
** Support for alternative fully qualified domain names (FQDN) for Clair that can leverage a global load balancing mechanism fronting different clusters running Clair.
+
For more information, see link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-2110[PROJQUAY-2210].

* With advanced Clair configuration, users can also provide a custom Clair configuration for an unmanaged Clair database on the {productname} Operator. An unmanaged Clair database allows the {productname} Operator to work in a Geo-Replicated environment, where multiple instances of the Operator must communicate with the same database. An unmanaged Clair database can also be used when a user requires a highly-available (HA) Clair database that exists outside of a cluster. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-1696[PROJQUAY-1969])

* Geo-replication is now available with the Red Hat Quay Operator. This feature allows multiple, geographically distributed Quay deployments to work as a single registry from the perspective of a client or user. It significantly improves push and pull performance in a globally-distributed Quay setup. Image data is asynchronously replicated in the background with transparent failover / redirect for clients. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-2504[PROJQUAY-2504])
