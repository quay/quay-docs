= Local storage

The following YAML shows an example configuration using local storage. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
Only use local storage when deploying a registry for _proof of concept_ purposes. It is not intended for production purposes. When using local storage, you must map the registry to a local directory to the `datastorage` path in the container when starting the registry. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html/proof_of_concept_-_deploying_red_hat_quay[Proof of Concept - Deploying {productname}]
