= LDAP Authentication Setup for {productname}

Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an open, vendor-neutral, industry standard application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an Internet Protocol (IP) network. {productname} supports using LDAP as an identity provider.

== Considerations when enabling LDAP

Prior to enabling LDAP for your {productname} deployment, you should consider the following.

[discrete]
[id="existing-quay-deployments"]
=== Existing {productname} deployments

Conflicts between usernames can arise when you enable LDAP for an existing {productname} deployment that already has users configured. For example, one user, `alice`, was manually created in {productname} prior to enabling LDAP. If the username `alice` also exists in the LDAP directory, {productname} automatically creates a new user, `alice-1`, when `alice` logs in for the first time using LDAP. {productname} then automatically maps the LDAP credentials to the `alice` account. For consistency reasons, this might be erroneous for your {productname} deployment. It is recommended that you remove any potentially conflicting local account names from {productname} prior to enabling LDAP.

[id="considerations-for-manual-user-creation"]
=== Manual User Creation and LDAP authentication

When {productname} is configured for LDAP, LDAP-authenticated users are automatically created in {productname}'s database on first log in, if the configuration option `FEATURE_USER_CREATION` is set to `true`. If this option is set to `false`, the automatic user creation for LDAP users fails, and the user is not allowed to log in. In this scenario, the superuser needs to create the desired user account first. Conversely, if `FEATURE_USER_CREATION` is set to `true`, this also means that a user can still create an account from the {productname} login screen, even if there is an equivalent user in LDAP.

== Configuring LDAP for {productname}

You can configure LDAP for {productname} by updating your `config.yaml` file directly and restarting your deployment. Use the following procedure as a reference when configuring LDAP for {productname}.

////
.Procedure

. You can use the {productname} config tool to configure LDAP.

.. Using the {productname} config tool, locate the *Authentication* section. Select *LDAP* from the dropdown menu, and update the LDAP configuration fields as required.
+
image:authentication-ldap.png[LDAP configuration fields]

.. Optional. On the *Team synchronization* box, and click *Enable Team Syncrhonization Support*. With team synchronization enabled, {productname} administrators who are also superusers can set teams to have their membership synchronized with a backing group in LDAP. 
+
image:authentication-ldap-team-sync-1.png[Team synchronization]

.. For *Resynchronization duration* enter *60m*. This option sets the resynchronization duration at which a team must be re-synchronized. This field must be set similar to the following examples: `30m`, `1h`, `1d`. 

.. Optional. For *Self-service team syncing setup*, you can click *Allow non-superusers to enable and manage team syncing* to allow superusers the ability to enable and manage team syncing under the organizations that they are administrators for. 
+
image:authentication-ldap-team-sync-2.png[Team synchronization]

.. Locate the *LDAP URI* box and provide a full LDAP URI, including the _ldap://_ or _ldaps://_ prefix, for example, `ldap://117.17.8.101`.
+
image:authentication-ldap-uri.png[LDAP server URI]

.. Under *Base DN*, provide a name which forms the base path for looking up all LDAP records, for example, `o=<organization_id>`,`dc=<example_domain_component>`,`dc=com`. 
+
image:authentication-ldap-basedn.png[Distinguished Names]

.. Under *User Relative DN*, provide a list of Distinguished Name path(s), which form the secondary base path(s) for looking up all user LDAP records relative to the *Base DN* defined above. For example, `uid=<name>`,`ou=Users`,`o=<organization_id>`,`dc=<example_domain_component>`,`dc=com`. This path, or these paths, is tried if the user is not found through the primary relative DN. 
+
image:user-relative-dn.png[User Relative DN]
+
[NOTE]
====
*User Relative DN* is relative to *Base DN*, for example, `ou=Users` and not `ou=Users,dc=<example_domain_component>,dc=com`.
====

.. Optional. Provide *Secondary User Relative DNs* if there are multiple Organizational Units where user objects are located. You can type in the Organizational Units and click *Add* to add multiple RDNs. For example, `ou=Users,ou=NYC and ou=Users,ou=SFO`. 
+
The *User Relative DN* searches with subtree scope. For example, if your organization has Organization Units `NYC` and `SFO` under the Users OU (that is, `ou=SFO,ou=Users` and `ou=NYC,ou=Users`), {productname} can authenticate users from both the `NYC` and `SFO` Organizational Units if the *User Relative DN* is set to `Users` (`ou=Users`). 

.. Optional. Fill in the *Additional User Filter Expression* field for all user lookup queries if desired. Distinguished Names used in the filter must be full based. The *Base DN* is not added automatically added to this field, and you must wrap the text in parentheses, for example, `(memberOf=cn=developers,ou=groups,dc=<example_domain_component>,dc=com)`.
+
image:authentication-ldap-user-filter.png[Additional User Filter]

.. Fill in the *Administrator DN* field for the {productname} administrator account. This account must be able to login and view the records for all users accounts. For example: `uid=<name>,ou=Users,o=<organization_id>,dc=<example_domain_component>,dc=com`. 
+
image:authentication-ldap-admin-dn.png[Administrator DN]

.. Fill in the *Administrator DN Password* field. This is the password for the administrator distinguished name. 
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The password for this field is stored in plaintext inside of the `config.yaml` file. Setting up a dedicated account of using a password hash is highly recommended. 
====

.. Optional. Fill in the *UID Attribute* field. This is the name of the property field in the LDAP user records that stores your user's username. Most commonly, *uid* is entered for this field. This field can be used to log into your {productname} deployment. 
+
image:uid-attribute-ldap.png[UID Attribute] 

.. Optional. Fill in the *Mail Attribute* field. This is the name of the property field in your LDAP user records that stores your user's e-mail addresses. Most commonly, *mail* is entered for this field. This field can be used to log into your {productname} deployment. 
+
image:mail-attribute-ldap.png[Mail Attribute]
+
[NOTE]
====
* The username to log in must exist in the *User Relative DN*. 
* If you are using Microsoft Active Directory to setup your LDAP deployment, you must use `sAMAccountName` for your UID attribute. 
====

.. Optional. You can add a custom SSL/TLS certificate by clicking *Choose File* under the *Custom TLS Certificate* optionl. Additionally, you can enable fallbacks to insecure, non-TLS connections by checking the *Allow fallback to non-TLS connections* box. 
+
image:authentication-ldap-ssl.png[LDAP server SSL]
+
If you upload an SSl/TLS certificate, you must provide an _ldaps://_ prefix, for example, `LDAP_URI: ldaps://ldap_provider.example.org`.

== Enabling the LDAP_RESTRICTED_USER_FILTER configuration field

The `LDAP_RESTRICTED_USER_FILTER` configuration field is a subset of the `LDAP_USER_FILTER` configuration field. When configured, this option allows {productname} administrators the ability to configure LDAP users as restricted users when {productname} uses LDAP as its authentication provider.

Use the following procedure to enable LDAP restricted users on your {productname} deployment. 

.Prerequisites 

* Your {productname} deployment uses LDAP as its authentication provider. 
* You have configured the `LDAP_USER_FILTER` field in your `config.yaml` file. 

.Procedure 

. In your deployment's `config.yaml` file, add the `LDAP_RESTRICTED_USER_FILTER` parameter and specify the group of restricted users, for example, `members`:

After enabling the `LDAP_RESTRICTED_USER_FILTER` feature, your LDAP {productname} users are restricted from reading and writing content, and creating organizations. 

[id="ldap-super-users-enabling"]
== Enabling the LDAP_SUPERUSER_FILTER configuration field

With the `LDAP_SUPERUSER_FILTER` field configured, {productname} administrators can configure Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) users as superusers if {productname} uses LDAP as its authentication provider. 

Use the following procedure to enable LDAP superusers on your {productname} deployment. 

.Prerequisites 

* Your {productname} deployment uses LDAP as its authentication provider. 
* You have configured the `LDAP_USER_FILTER` field field in your `config.yaml` file. 

.Procedure 

. In your deployment's `config.yaml` file, add the `LDAP_SUPERUSER_FILTER` parameter and add the group of users you want configured as super users, for example, `root`:

. Start, or restart, your {productname} deployment. 

After enabling the `LDAP_SUPERUSER_FILTER` feature, your LDAP {productname} users have superuser privileges. The following options are available to superusers:

* Manage users
* Manage organizations
* Manage service keys
* View the change log
* Query the usage logs
* Create globally visible user messages 

[id="common-ldap-configuration-issues"]
== Common LDAP configuration issues 

The following errors might be returned with an invalid configuration. 

* **Invalid credentials**. If you receive this error, the Administrator DN or Administrator DN password values are incorrect. Ensure that you are providing accurate Administrator DN and password values. 

* **Verification of superuser %USERNAME% failed*. This error is returned for the following reasons: 

** The username has not been found. 
** The user does not exist in the remote authentication system. 
** LDAP authorization is configured improperly. 

* **Cannot find the current logged in user**. When configuring LDAP for {productname}, there may be situations where the LDAP connection is established successfully using the username and password provided in the *Administrator DN* fields. However, if the current logged-in user cannot be found within the specified *User Relative DN* path using the *UID Attribute* or *Mail Attribute* fields, there are typically two potential reasons for this:

** The current logged in user does not exist in the *User Relative DN* path.
** The *Administrator DN* does not have rights to search or read the specified LDAP path. 
+
To fix this issue, ensure that the logged in user is included in the *User Relative DN* path, or provide the correct permissions to the *Administrator DN* account.
