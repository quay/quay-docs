= LDAP Authentication Setup for {productname}

The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an open,
vendor-neutral, industry standard application protocol for accessing and
maintaining distributed directory information services over an Internet
Protocol (IP) network. {productname} supports using LDAP as an
identity provider.

== Considerations prior to enabling LDAP

[[considerations-for-existing-quay-deployments]]
=== Existing Quay deployments
If you are enabling to LDAP for an existing Quay deployment, that already has users configured, you need to be aware of potential user name conflicts. If a user `alice` got created manually in Quay prior to enabling LDAP, and the same user also exists in the LDAP directory, upon logging for the first time as `alice` from LDAP, Quay will create a user `alice-1` and map the LDAP credentials to this account. This might be undesirable for consistency reasons and the recommendation is to remove potentially conflicting local account names from Quay prior to enabling LDAP.

[[considerations-for-manual-user-creation]]
=== Manual User Creation and LDAP authentication

When Quay is configured for LDAP, LDAP-authenticated users are automatically created in Quay's database, the first time they are logging in. For this to work the configuration option `FEATURE_USER_CREATION` needs to be set to `true`. If it is set to `false` the automatic user creation for LDAP users will fail and the user is not allowed to log in. In this scenario the superuser needs to create the desired user account first.
Conversely, if `FEATURE_USER_CREATION` is set to `true`, this also means that users can still create their own account from the Quay login screen, regardless of whether the account is mapping to a user in LDAP or not.

[[setup-ldap-configuration]]
== Set Up LDAP Configuration

In the config tool, locate the Authentication section and select “LDAP” from the drop-down menu. Update LDAP configuration fields as required.

image:authentication-ldap.png[Fill in LDAP information]

* Here is an example of the resulting entry in the _config.yaml_ file:
....
AUTHENTICATION_TYPE: LDAP
....

=== Full LDAP URI

image:authentication-ldap-uri.png[LDAP server URI]
image:authentication-ldap-ssl.png[LDAP server SSL]

* The full LDAP URI, including the _ldap://_ or _ldaps://_ prefix.
* A URI beginning with _ldaps://_ will make use of the provided SSL certificate(s) for TLS setup.
* Here is an example of the resulting entry in the _config.yaml_ file:
....
LDAP_URI: ldaps://ldap.example.org
....

=== Team Synchronization

image:authentication-ldap-team-sync-1.png[Team synchronization]

* If enabled, organization administrators who are also superusers can set teams to have their membership synchronized with a backing group in LDAP.

image:authentication-ldap-team-sync-2.png[Team synchronization]

* The resynchronization duration is the period at which a team must be re-synchronized. Must be expressed in a duration string form: 30m, 1h, 1d.
* Optionally allow non-superusers to enable and manage team syncing under organizations in which they are administrators.
* Here is an example of the resulting entries in the _config.yaml_ file:
....
FEATURE_TEAM_SYNCING: true
TEAM_RESYNC_STALE_TIME: 60m
FEATURE_NONSUPERUSER_TEAM_SYNCING_SETUP: true
....

=== Base and Relative Distinguished Names

image:authentication-ldap-basedn.png[Distinguished Names]

* A Distinguished Name path which forms the base path for looking up all LDAP records. Example: _dc=my,dc=domain,dc=com_
* Optional list of Distinguished Name path(s) which form the secondary base path(s) for looking up all user LDAP records, relative to the Base DN defined above. These path(s) will be tried if the user is not found via the primary relative DN.
* User Relative DN is relative to BaseDN. Example: _ou=NYC_ not _ou=NYC,dc=example,dc=org_
* Multiple “Secondary User Relative DNs” may be entered if there are multiple Organizational Units where User objects are located at. Simply type in the Organizational Units and click on Add button to add multiple RDNs. Example: _ou=Users,ou=NYC and ou=Users,ou=SFO_
* The "User Relative DN" searches with subtree scope. For example, if your Organization has Organizational Units NYC and SFO under the Users OU (_ou=SFO,ou=Users_ and _ou=NYC,ou=Users_), {productname} can authenticate users from both the _NYC_ and _SFO_ Organizational Units if the User Relative DN is set to Users (_ou=Users_).
* Here is an example of the resulting entries in the _config.yaml_ file:
....
LDAP_BASE_DN:
- dc=example
- dc=com
LDAP_USER_RDN:
- ou=users
LDAP_SECONDARY_USER_RDNS:
- ou=bots
- ou=external
....

=== Additional User Filters

image:authentication-ldap-user-filter.png[User filters]

* If specified, the additional filter used for all user lookup queries. Note that all Distinguished Names used in the filter must be *full* paths; the Base DN is not added automatically here. *Must* be wrapped in parens. Example: (&(someFirstField=someValue)(someOtherField=someOtherValue))
* Here is an example of the resulting entry in the _config.yaml_ file:
....
LDAP_USER_FILTER: (memberof=cn=developers,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com)
....

=== Administrator DN

image:authentication-ldap-admin-dn.png[Administrator DN]

* The Distinguished Name  and password for the administrator account. This account must be able to login and view the records for all user accounts. Example: uid=admin,ou=employees,dc=my,dc=domain,dc=com
* The password will be stored in *plaintext* inside the config.yaml, so setting up a dedicated account or using a password hash is highly recommended.
* Here is an example of the resulting entries in the _config.yaml_ file:
....
LDAP_ADMIN_DN: cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com
LDAP_ADMIN_PASSWD: changeme
....

=== UID and Mail attributes

image:authentication-ldap-uid-mail.png[UID and Mail]

* The UID attribute is the name of the property field in LDAP user record to use as the *username*. Typically "uid".
* The Mail attribute is the name of the property field in LDAP user record that stores user e-mail address(es). Typically "mail".
* Either of these may be used during login.
* The logged in username must exist in User Relative DN.
* _sAMAccountName_ is the UID attribute for against Microsoft Active Directory setups.
* Here is an example of the resulting entries in the _config.yaml_ file:
....
LDAP_UID_ATTR: uid
LDAP_EMAIL_ATTR: mail
....

=== Validation

Once the configuration is completed, click on “Save Configuration
Changes” button to validate the configuration.

image:authentication-ldap-success.png[Fill in LDAP information]

All validation must succeed before proceeding, or additional configuration may be performed by selecting the "Continue Editing" button.

[[common-issues]]
== Common Issues

*_Invalid credentials_*

Administrator DN or Administrator DN Password values are incorrect

*_Verification of superuser %USERNAME% failed: Username not found The
user either does not exist in the remote authentication system OR LDAP
auth is misconfigured._*

{productname} can connect to the LDAP server via Username/Password specified in
the Administrator DN fields however cannot find the current logged in
user with the UID Attribute or Mail Attribute fields in the User
Relative DN Path. Either current logged in user does not exist in User
Relative DN Path, or Administrator DN user do not have rights to
search/read this LDAP path.

[[configure-ldap-superuser]]
== Configure an LDAP user as superuser
Once LDAP is configured, you can log in to your {productname}
instance with a valid LDAP username and password. 
You are prompted to confirm your {productname} username as shown in the following figure:

image:confirm-ldap-username.png[Confirm LDAP username for {productname}]

To attach superuser privilege to an LDAP user, modify the _config.yaml_ file
with the username. For example:

....
SUPER_USERS:
- testadmin
....

Restart the Red Hat `Quay` container with the updated config.yaml file. 
The next time you log in, the user will have superuser privileges.
