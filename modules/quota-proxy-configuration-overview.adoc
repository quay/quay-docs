= Quota management and proxy cache features

This section outlines configuration fields related to enforcing storage limits and improving image availability through proxy caching.

These features help registry administrators:

* Control how much storage organizations and users consume with configurable quotas.
* Improve access to upstream images by caching remote content locally via proxy cache.
* Monitor and manage resource consumption and availability across distributed environments.

Collectively, these capabilities ensure better performance, governance, and resiliency in managing container image workflows.
