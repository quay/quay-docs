= Clair Notifications

When Clair received a new vulnerability affecting a previously indexed manifest, it will notify {productname} so that a new scan can be requested.  Only the most severe vulnerabilities trigger a notification to avoid excessive scan requests.  This notification mechanism is automatically set up when Clair is configured in {productname}'s configuration.

Clair notifications can also be set up for external consumption via AMQP and STOMP protocols.  For details on how to set this up please consult the link:https://quay.github.io/clair/concepts/notifications.html[upstream Clair documentation].
