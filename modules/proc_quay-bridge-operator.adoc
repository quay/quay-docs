= Integrate {productname} into OpenShift with the Bridge Operator

Using the Quay Bridge Operator, you can replace the integrated container
registry in OpenShift with a {productname} registry. By doing this, your
integrated OpenShift registry becomes a highly available, enterprise-grade
{productname} registry with enhanced role based access control (RBAC) features.

The primary goals of the Bridge Operator is to duplicate the features of the
integrated OpenShift registry in the new {productname} registry. The features
enabled with this Operator include:

* Synchronizing OpenShift namespaces as {productname} organizations.
  - Creating Robot accounts for each default namespace service account
  - Creating Secrets for each created Robot Account (associating each
Robot Secret to a Service Account as Mountable and Image Pull Secret)
  - Synchronizing OpenShift ImageStreams as Quay Repositories
* Automatically rewriting new Builds making use of ImageStreams to output to {productname}
* Automatically importing an ImageStream tag once a build completes

Using this procedure with the Quay Bridge Operator, you enable bi-directional communication between your {productname} and OpenShift clusters.

[WARNING]
====
You cannot have more than one OpenShift Container Platform cluster
pointing to the same {productname} instance from a Quay Bridge Operator.
If you did, it would prevent you from creating namespaces
of the same name on the two clusters.
====

== Running the Quay Bridge Operator

=== Prerequisites

Before setting up the Bridge Operator, have the following in place:

* An existing {productname} environment for which you have superuser permissions
* A Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform environment (4.2 or later is recommended)
for which you have cluster administrator permissions
* An OpenShift command line tool (`oc` command)

=== Setting up and configuring OpenShift and {productname}

Both {productname} and OpenShift configuration is required:

=== {productname} setup

Create a dedicated {productname} organization, and from a new application
you create within that organization, generate an OAuth token
to be used with the Quay Bridge Operator in OpenShift

. Log in to {productname} as a user with superuser access and select the
organization for which the external application will be configured.
. In the left navigation, select Applications.
. Select `Create New Application` and entering a name for the new application (for example, `openshift`).
. With the new application displayed, select it.
. In the left navigation, select `Generate Token` to create a new OAuth2 token.
. Select all checkboxes to grant the access needed for the integration.
. Review the assigned permissions and then select `Authorize Application`, then confirm it.
. Copy and save the generated Access Token that appears to use in the next section.

=== OpenShift Setup
Setting up OpenShift for the Quay Bridge Operator requires several steps, including:

==== Deploying the Operator
The fastest method for deploying the operator is to deploy from OperatorHub. From the Administrator perspective in the OpenShift Web Console, navigate to the Operators tab, and then select OperatorHub.

Search for Quay Bridge Operator and then select Install.

Select an Approval Strategy and then select Install which will deploy the operator to the cluster.



==== Creating an OpenShift secret for the OAuth token 

The Operator will use the previously obtained Access Token to communicate with Quay. Store this token within OpenShift as a secret.

Execute the following command to create a secret called `quay-integration` in the `openshift-operators` namespace with a key called `token` containing the access token:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc create secret -n openshift-operators generic quay-integration --from-literal=token=<access_token>
----

==== Create the QuayIntegration Custom Resource

Finally, to complete the integration between OpenShift and Quay, a `QuayIntegration` custom resource needs to be created. This can be completed in the Web Console or from the command line.

.quay-integration.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: quay.redhat.com/v1
kind: QuayIntegration
metadata:
  name: example-quayintegration
spec:
  clusterID: openshift  <1>
  credentialsSecret:
    namespace: openshift-operators
    name: quay-integration<2>
  quayHostname: https://<QUAY_URL>   <3>
  insecureRegistry: false <4>
----
<1> The clusterID value should be unique across the entire ecosystem. This value is optional and defaults to `openshift`.
<2> The `credentialsSecret` property refers to the namespace and name of the secret containing the token that was previously created.
<3> Replace QUAY_URL with the hostname of your {productname} instance.
<4> If Quay is using self signed certificates, set the property `insecureRegistry: true`.


Create the `QuayIntegration` Custom Resource:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc create -f quay-integration.yaml
----

At this point a Quay integration resource is created, linking the OpenShift cluster to the {productname} instance. Organizations within Quay should be created for the related namespaces from the OpenShift environment
