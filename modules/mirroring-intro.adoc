= Repository mirroring

{productname} repository mirroring lets you mirror images from external container registries, or another local registry, into your {productname} cluster. Using repository mirroring, you can synchronize images to {productname} based on repository names and tags.

With repository mirroring enabled, you can perform the following features: 

* Choose a repository from an external registry to mirror
* Add credentials to access the external registry 
* Identify specific container image repository names and tags to sync
* Set intervals at which a repository is synced
* Check the current state of synchronization


In order to use the mirroring functionality, the following must be done: 

. Enable Repository Mirroring in the {productname} configuration. 
. Run a repository mirroring worker.
. Create a mirrored repository.

All repository mirroring configuration can be performed using the configuration tool UI or via the Quay API
