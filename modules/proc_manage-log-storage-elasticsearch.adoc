= Configuring action log storage for Elasticsearch

[NOTE]
====
To configure action log storage for Elasticsearch, you must provide your own Elasticsearch stack, as it is not included with {productname} as a customizable component.
====

Enabling Elasticsearch logging can be done during {productname} deployment
or post-deployment using the {productname} configuration tool. The resulting
configuration is stored in the `config.yaml` file.
When configured, usage log access continues to be provided through the web UI
for repositories and organizations.

Use the following procedure to configure action log storage for Elasticsearch:

.Procedure

. Obtain an Elasticsearch account.
. Open the {productname} Config Tool (either during or after {productname} deployment).
. Scroll to the *Action Log Storage Configuration* setting and select
*Elasticsearch*. The following figure shows the Elasticsearch settings
that appear:

. Fill in the following information for your Elasticsearch instance:
+
* **Elasticsearch hostname**: The hostname or IP address of the system providing
the Elasticsearch service.
* **Elasticsearch port**: The port number providing the Elasticsearch service on the host
you just entered. Note that the port must be accessible from all systems
running the {productname} registry. The default is TCP port 9200.
* **Elasticsearch access key**: The access key needed to gain access to the Elastic search
service, if required.
* **Elasticsearch secret key**: The secret key needed to gain access to the Elastic search
service, if required.
* **AWS region**: If you are running on AWS, set the AWS region (otherwise, leave it blank).
* **Index prefix**: Choose a prefix to attach to log entries.
* **Logs Producer**: Choose either Elasticsearch (default) or Kinesis to direct logs to
an intermediate Kinesis stream on AWS. You need to set up your own pipeline to
send logs from Kinesis to Elasticsearch (for example, Logstash). The following figure
shows additional fields you would need to fill in for Kinesis:
+

. If you chose Elasticsearch as the Logs Producer, no further configuration is needed.
If you chose Kinesis, fill in the following:
+
* **Stream name**: The name of the Kinesis stream.
* **AWS access key**: The name of the AWS access key needed to gain access to the Kinesis stream, if required.
* **AWS secret key**: The name of the AWS secret key needed to gain access to the Kinesis stream, if required.
* **AWS region**: The AWS region.

. When you are done, save the configuration. The configuration tool checks your settings.
If there is a problem connecting to the Elasticsearch or Kinesis services,
you will see an error and have the opportunity to continue editing. Otherwise,
logging will begin to be directed to your Elasticsearch configuration after the
cluster restarts with the new configuration.
