The following section highlights notable technical changes for {productname} 3.15.

[id="model-card-disable"]
== Model card rendering disabled by default

In {productname} 3.14, model card rendering was made available on the v2 UI for machine learning models. This feature was enabled by default via the `FEATURE_UI_MODELCARD` parameter.

With {productname} 3.15, this feature is now disabled by default. To view model cards on the v2 UI, you must set the `FEATURE_UI_MODELCARD` field to `True`. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
# ...
FEATURE_UI_MODELCARD: true
# ...
----

This change will be reverted in a future version of {productname}.
