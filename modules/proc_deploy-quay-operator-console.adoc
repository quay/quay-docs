Select a sample metric, for example, `quay_org_rows`:

This metric shows the number of organizations in the registry, and it is directly surfaced in the dashboard as well.

== Alerting

An alert is raised if the Quay pods restart too often. The alert can be configured by accessing the Alerting rules tab from Monitoring -> Alerting in the consol UI and searching for the Quay-specific alert:
