[[quay-upgrade-guide]]
= {productname} upgrade guide

This document describes how to upgrade one or more Quay containers.

[[backup-the-quay-enterprise-database]]
== Backup the Quay database

The database is the "source of truth" for Quay, and some version
upgrades will trigger a schema update and data migration. Such versions
are clearly documented in the
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/red_hat_quay_release_notes/[Red Hat Quay Release Notes].

Backup the database before upgrading Quay. Once the backup
completes, use the procedure in this document to stop the running Quay container, start the new container, and check the health of
the upgraded Quay service.

[[provide-quay-credentials-to-the-docker-client]]
== Provide Quay credentials to the Docker client

```
# docker login quay.io
```

[[pull-the-latest-quay-enterprise-release-from-the-repository]]
== Pull the latest Quay release from the repository.

Check the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/2.9/html-single/red_hat_quay_release_notes/[list of Red Hat Quay releases] for the latest version.

```
# docker pull quay.io/coreos/registry:RELEASE_VERSION
```

Replace `RELEASE VERSION` with the desired version of Quay.

[[find-the-running-quay-container-id]]
== Find the running Quay container ID

```
# docker ps -a
```

The Quay image will be labeled `quay.io/coreos/registry`.

[[stop-the-existing-quay-container]]
== Stop the existing Quay container

```
# docker stop QUAY_CONTAINER_ID
```

[[start-the-new-quay-enterprise-container]]
== Start the new Quay container

```
# docker run --restart=always -p 443:443 -p 80:80 \
   --sysctl net.core.somaxconn=4096 \
   --privileged=true \
   -v /mnt/quay/config:/conf/stack:Z \
   -v /mnt/quay/storage:/datastorage:Z \
   -d quay.io/coreos/registry:RELEASE_VERSION
```

Replace `RELEASE_VERSION` with the desired Quay version.

Rarely, but occasionally, the new Quay version may perform a
database schema upgrade and migration. Versions requiring such database
migrations will take potentially much longer to start the first time.
These versions are clearly documented in the
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/2.9/html-single/red_hat_quay_release_notes//[{productname} Release Notes], which
should be consulted before each {productname} upgrade.

[[check-the-health-of-the-upgraded-container]]
== Check the health of the upgraded container

Visit the /health/endtoend endpoint on the registry hostname and verify
that the code is 200 and `is_testing` is false.

[[upgrade-all-containers-in-the-cluster]]
== Upgrade the rest of the containers in the cluster.

If the upgraded container is healthy, repeat this process for all
remaining Quay containers.
