= {productname} sample sizings

The following table shows approximate sizing for Proof of Concept, mid-size, and high-end deployments. Whether a deployment runs appropriately with the same metrics depends on many factors not shown below.

| No. of Clair containers by default | 1 | 3 | 10
| No. of Clair containers max at scale-out | N/A | 6 | 15

The sizing for the Redis cache is only relevant if you use Quay builders, otherwise it is not significant.
