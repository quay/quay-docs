= {productname} Sample Sizings 

The following table shows typical sizing for three deployment sizes: proof of concept, mid-size, and high-end. Whether a deployment runs appropriately with the same metrics will depend on many other factors not shown below. 



[width="100%",cols="2,^,^,^"options="header"]
|====
| Metric | Proof of concept |  Mid-size | High End + 
(Quay.io)
| No. of Quay containers by default | 1 | 4 | 15
| No. of Quay containers max at scale-out | N/A | 8 | 30
| No. of Clair containers by default | 1 | 3 | 10
| No. of Clair containers max at scale-out | N/A | 6 | 15
| No. of mirroring pods (to mirror 100 repos) | 1 | 5-10 | N/A
.^| Database sizing| 2 -4 Cores +  
6-8  GB RAM + 
10-20GB disk
| 4-8 Cores +

For further details on sizing & related recommendations for mirroring, see the section on xref:mirroring-intro[repository mirroring]. 

The sizing for the Redis cache is only relevant if you use Quay builders, otherwise it is insignificant.
