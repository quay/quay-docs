[[set-up-red-hat-quay-services]]
= Set up {productname} services

Deploying {productname} on OpenShift requires you to create a set of yaml files.
Although the `oc` command is used to configure the {productname} registry here,
you could use the OpenShift web UI instead, if you prefer.

Refer to Appendix A for the contents of these yaml files.

Here are a few
things to keep in mind:

* Your OpenShift account must have permission to create namespaces
at the cluster scope.

* {productname} runs under its own namespace inside a Kubernetes cluster, so that needs to be created first. You can create it through the `New project` in the OpenShift web console or using quay-enterprise-namespace.yaml (as described here).

* You need a working enterprise-quality database.
In our example, we illustrate PostgreSQL
(version 9.4 or above is required, although we recommend 9.6).

* You can use an existing Redis service (needed for build logs and the {productname} tutorial) or start one
as described in this procedure.

Here are the major steps, detailed below, to complete a Red Hat Quay deployment on OpenShift:

. Set up the Red Hat Quay namespace and secrets
. Create the Red Hat Quay database
. Create Red Hat Quay roles and privileges
. Create the Redis deployment
. Prepare to configure Red Hat Quay
. Start the Red Hat Quay configuration user interface
. Deploy the Red Hat Quay configuration
. Add Clair image scanning
. Add repository mirroring

[[set-up-namespaces-secrets]]
== Set up {productname}  namespaces and secrets

. **Get {productname} yaml files**: Create a set of yaml files in a directory on your local system
from the contents shown in Appendix A. Study each file to determine where you might need to make modifications.
You will use `oc create` to create the needed resources from those files.

. **Log in with oc cli**. Login as a user with cluster scope permissions to the OpenShift cluster. For example:
+
```
$ oc login -u system:admin
```

. **Create namespace**. Run `oc create` `quay-enterprise-namespace.yaml` and then make
`quay-enterprise` the current project. All objects will be deployed to this namespace/project:
+
```
$ oc create -f quay-enterprise-namespace.yaml
namespace "quay-enterprise" created
$ oc project quay-enterprise
```

. **Create the secret for the {productname} configuration and app**: Create the following secrets.
During {productname} configuration, the config.yaml, and optionally the ssl.cert and ssl.key, files
are added to the application's secret, so they can be included with the resulting {productname} application:
+
```
$ oc create -f quay-enterprise-config-secret.yaml
secret/quay-enterprise-config-secret created
$ oc create secret generic quay-enterprise-secret
```

. **Create the secret for quay.io**.
This pull secret provides credentials to pull containers from the Quay.io registry.
Refer to link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3533201[Accessing Red Hat {productname}] to get
the credentials you need to add to the quay-enterprise-redhat-quay-pull-secret.yaml file, then run `oc create`:
+
```
$ oc create -f quay-enterprise-redhat-quay-pull-secret.yaml
secret/redhat-quay-pull-secret created
```

. **Create the database**. If you are not using your own enterprise-quality
database (recommended), this procedure illustrates how to set up a Postgresql database
on an OpenShift cluster. This entails creating AWS storage, a postgres deployment,
and postgres service, then adding an extension to the database (see the description of
`quay-storageclass.yaml` in Appendix A for information on adding encryption to your volumes):
+
```
$ oc create -f quay-storageclass.yaml
storageclass.storage.k8s.io/quay-storageclass created
$ oc create -f db-pvc.yaml
persistentvolumeclaim/postgres-storage created
$ oc create -f postgres-deployment.yaml
deployment.extensions/postgres-new created
$ oc create -f postgres-service.yaml
service/postgres created
```
+
```
$ oc get pods -n quay-enterprise
NAME                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
postgres-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxx   1/1     Running   0          3m26s
```
+
Run the following command, replacing the name of the postgres pod with your pod:
+
```
$ oc exec -it postgres-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxx -n quay-enterprise -- /bin/bash -c 'echo "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm" | /opt/rh/rh-postgresql10/root/usr/bin/psql -d quay'
```
+
[NOTE]
====
The `-d database_name` must not be omitted. If it is,
the extension will be created on the default PostgreSQL
database.
====

. **Create a serviceaccount for the database**: Create a serviceaccount and grant
it anyuid privilege.
Running the PostgreSQL deployment under anyuid lets you add
persistent storage to the deployment and allow it to store db metadata.

+
```
# oc create serviceaccount postgres -n quay-enterprise
serviceaccount/postgres created
# oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z system:serviceaccount:quay-enterprise:postgres
scc "anyuid" added to: ["system:serviceaccount:quay-enterprise:system:serviceaccount:quay-enterprise:postgres"]
```

. **Create the role and the role binding**: {productname} has native Kubernetes
integrations. These integrations require Service Account to have access to the
Kubernetes API. When Kubernetes RBAC is enabled, Role
Based Access Control policy manifests also have to be deployed. This role will
be used to run {productname} and also to write the config.yaml file that {productname} creates at
the end of the web interface setup:
+
```
$ oc create -f quay-servicetoken-role-k8s1-6.yaml
$ oc create -f quay-servicetoken-role-binding-k8s1-6.yaml
```

. **Add privilege**: Make sure that the service account has root privileges, because {productname} runs strictly under root (this will be changed in the future versions). Throughout this example, the namespace is `quay-enterprise`:
+
```
$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid \
     system:serviceaccount:quay-enterprise:default
```
. **Create Redis deployment**: If you haven't already deployed Redis, create a `quay-enterprise-redis.yaml` file and deploy it:
+
```
$ oc create -f quay-enterprise-redis.yaml
```

. **Set up to configure {productname}**: {productname} V3 added a tool for configuring
the {productname} service before deploying it. Although the config tool
is in the same container as the full {productname} service, it is deployed
in a different way, as follows:
+
```
$ oc create -f quay-enterprise-config.yaml
$ oc create -f quay-enterprise-config-service-clusterip.yaml
$ oc create -f quay-enterprise-config-route.yaml
```
+
The quay configuration container is now set up to be accessed from port 443 from your Web browser.
Before creating the configuration, however, you need to create a route to the permanent {productname} service.
This is because we need the {productname} service's publicly available FQDN when setting up the application.

. **Start the {productname} application**: Identify the {productname} Kubernetes service and create a route for it, then start
the {productname} application as follows:
+
```
$ oc create -f quay-enterprise-service-clusterip.yaml
service/quay-enterprise-clusterip created
$ oc create -f quay-enterprise-app-route.yaml
route.route.openshift.io/quay-enterprise created
$ oc create -f quay-enterprise-app-rc.yaml
deployment.extensions/quay-enterprise-app created
```
+
[NOTE]
====
The creation of the {productname} application (quay-enterprise-app pod)
will not complete until you have finished configuring the application.
So don't worry if you see that pod remain in "ContainerCreating" status
until the configuration is done.
At that point, the new configuration is fed to the application and it
will change to the "Running" state.
====
+
You will need to know the route to the {productname} application when you
do the configuration step.

. **Begin to configure {productname}**: Open the public route to the {productname} configuration container in a Web browser.
To see the route to the quay configuration service, type the following:
+
```
$ oc get route -n quay-enterprise quay-enterprise-config
NAME                   HOST/PORT                                                                          PATH   SERVICES                    PORT    TERMINATION   WILDCARD
quay-enterprise-config quay-enterprise-config-quay-enterprise.apps.test.example.com quay-enterprise-config    <all> passthrough  None
```
+
For this example, you would open this URL in your web browser:
https://quay-enterprise-config-quay-enterprise.apps.test.example.com

. **Log in as quayconfig**: When prompted, enter the username and password
(the password was set as an argument to the quay config container in:
`quay-enterprise-config.yaml`):

- User Name: **quayconfig**

- Password: **secret**

+
You are prompted to select a configuration mode, as shown in the following figure:
+
image:Figure00.png[Identifying the database {productname} will use]


. **Choose configuration mode**: Select "Start new configuration for this cluster"
The result of this selection is the creation of a new
configuration file (`config.yaml`) that you will use later for your {productname} deployment.

. **Identify the database**: For the initial setup, add the following information about the type and location of the database to be used by {productname}:
- **Database Type**: Choose MySQL or PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL is used with the
example shown here.
- **Database Server**: Identify the IP address or hostname of the database,
along with the port number if it is different from 3306.
- **Username**: Identify a user with full access to the database.
- **Password**: Enter the password you assigned to the selected user.
- **Database Name**: Enter the database name you assigned when you started the database server.
- **SSL Certificate**: For production environments, you should provide an SSL certificate to connect to the database.
+
To verify the NAME of the service (postgres), type the following:
+
```
$ oc get services -n quay-enterprise postgres
NAME      TYPE      CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
postgres  NodePort  172.30.127.41  <none>        5432:32212/TCP   19h
```
+
The following figure shows an example of the screen for identifying the database used by {productname}.
The example yaml file sets the database server to `postgres`,
the user name to `username`, the password to `password`, and the database to `quay`:
+
image:Figure01.png[Identifying the database {productname} will use]

+
. **Validate database**: Select `Validate Database Settings` and proceed to the next screen.

. **Create {productname} superuser**: You need to set up an account with superuser privileges to {productname}, to use for editing {productname} configuration settings. That information includes a Username, Email address, and Password (entered twice).
+
The following figure shows an example of the {productname} Setup screen for setting up a {productname} superuser account:
+
image:Figure03.png[Set up a {productname} superuser account to do {productname} configuration]
+
Select `Create Super User`, and proceed to the next screen.

. **Identify settings**: Go through each of the following settings. The minimum you must enter includes:
+
- **Server hostname**: The URL to the {productname} service is required.
+
- **Redis hostname**: The URL or IP address to the Redis service is required.
+
Here are all the settings you need to consider:
+
- **Custom SSL Certificates**: Upload custom or self-signed SSL certificates for use by {productname}. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html-single/manage_red_hat_quay/index#using-ssl-to-protect-quay[Using SSL to protect connections to {productname}] for details. Recommended for high availability.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Using SSL certificates is recommended for both basic
and high availability deployments. If you decide to
not use SSL, you must configure your container clients
to use your new {productname} setup as an insecure registry
as described in link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/insecure/[Test an Insecure Registry].
====

- **Basic Configuration**: Upload a company logo to rebrand your {productname} registry.
- **Server Configuration**: Hostname or IP address to reach the {productname} service, along with TLS indication (recommended for production installations). To get the route to the permanent {productname} service, type the following:
+
```
$ oc get route -n quay-enterprise quay-enterprise
NAME            HOST/PORT                                                               PATH SERVICES                  PORT TERMINATION WILDCARD
quay-enterprise quay-enterprise-quay-enterprise.apps.cnegus-ocp.devcluster.openshift.com     quay-enterprise-clusterip <all>            None
```
See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html-single/manage_red_hat_quay/index#using-ssl-to-protect-quay[Using SSL to protect connections to {productname}]. TLS termination can be done in two different ways:
  ** On the instance itself, with all TLS traffic governed by the nginx server in the quay container (recommended).
  ** On the load balancer. This is not recommended. Access to {productname} could be lost if the TLS setup is not done correctly on the load balancer.

- **Data Consistency Settings**: Select to relax logging consistency guarantees to improve performance and availability.
- **Time Machine**: Allow older image tags to remain in the repository for set periods of time and allow users to select their own tag expiration times.
- **redis**: Identify the hostname or IP address (and optional password) to connect to the redis service used by {productname}. To find the address of the redis service, type the following:
+
```
$ oc get services -n quay-enterprise quay-enterprise-redis
NAME                  TYPE       CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S)  AGE
quay-enterprise-redis ClusterIP  172.30.207.35 <none>      6379/TCP 40m
```
- **Repository Mirroring**: Choose the checkbox to Enable Repository Mirroring.
With this enabled, you can create repositories in your {productname} cluster that mirror
selected repositories from remote registries. Before you can enable repository mirroring,
start the repository mirroring worker as described later in this procedure.
- **Registry Storage**: Identify the location of storage. A variety of cloud and local storage options are available. Remote storage is required for high availability. Identify the Ceph storage location
if you are following the example for {productname} high availability storage. On OpenShift, the example uses Amazon S3 storage.
- **Action Log Rotation and Archiving**: Select to enable log rotation, which moves logs older than 30 days into storage, then indicate storage area.
- **Security Scanner**: We recommend setting up the Clair security scanner after
you have completed the initial {productname} deployment. Clair setup is described
after the end of this procedure.
- **Application Registry**: Enable an additional application registry that includes things like Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts (see the link:https://github.com/app-registry[App Registry specification]).
- **BitTorrent-based download**: Allow all registry images to be downloaded using BitTorrent protocol (using the link:https://github.com/coreos/quayctl[`quayctl`] tool).
- **rkt Conversion**: Allow `rkt fetch` to be used to fetch images from the {productname} registry. Public and private GPG2 keys are needed (see link:https://coreos.com/quay-enterprise/docs/latest/aci-signing-keys.html[Generating signing keys for ACI conversion] for details.
This field is deprecated.
- **E-mail**: Enable e-mail to use for notifications and user password resets.
- **Internal Authentication**: Change default authentication for the registry from Local Database to LDAP, Keystone (OpenStack), JWT Custom Authentication, or External Application Token.
- **External Authorization (OAuth)**: Enable to allow GitHub or GitHub Enterprise to authenticate to the registry.
- **Google Authentication**: Enable to allow Google to authenticate to the registry.
- **Access settings**: Basic username/password authentication is enabled by default. Other authentication types that can be enabled include: external application tokens (user-generated tokens used with docker or rkt commands), anonymous access (enable for public access to anyone who can get to the registry), user creation (let users create their own accounts), encrypted client password (require command-line user access to include encrypted passwords), and prefix username autocompletion (disable to require exact username matches on autocompletion).
* **Registry Protocol Settings**: Leave the `Restrict V1 Push Support` checkbox enabled
to restrict access to Docker V1 protocol pushes.
Although Red Hat recommends against enabling Docker V1 push protocol, if you do allow it,
you must explicitly whitelist the namespaces for which it is enabled.
- **Dockerfile Build Support**: Enable to allow users to submit Dockerfiles to be built and pushed to {productname}.
This is not recommended for multitenant environments.

. **Save the changes**: Select `Save Configuration Changes`. You are presented with the following Download Configuration screen:
+
image:Figure04.png[Download the {productname} configuration tarball to the local system]
. **Download configuration**: Select the `Download Configuration` button and save the
tarball (`quay-config.tar.gz`) to a local directory. Save this file in case you want to deploy
the config files inside manually or just want a record of what you deployed.

. **Deploy configuration**: Select to rollout the deployment. When prompted, click
`Populate configuration to deployments` to deploy the configuration to the {productname}
application. In a few minutes, you should see a green checkmark and the message "Configuration successfully rolled out and deployed!"
+
[NOTE]
====
If for some reason the deployment doesn't complete, try deleting the quay-enterprise-app pod.
OpenShift should create a new pod and pick up the needed configuration. If that doesn't work,
unpack the configuration files (`tar xvf quay-config.tar.gz`) and add them
manually to the secret:
```
$ oc create secret generic quay-enterprise-config-secret -n quay-enterprise \
     --from-file=config.yaml=/path/to/config.yaml \
     --from-file=ssl.key=/path/to/ssl.key \
     --from-file=ssl.cert=/path/to/ssl.cert
```
====

. **Check pods**: In a couple of minutes (depending on your connection speed), {productname}
should be up and running and the following pods should be visible in the quay-enterprise namespace
You might get a mount error at first, but that should resolve itself:
+
```
$ oc get pods -n quay-enterprise
NAME                                        READY STATUS  RESTARTS AGE
postgres-5b4c5d7dd9-f8tqz                   1/1   Running 0        46h
quay-enterprise-app-7899c7c77f-jrsrc        1/1   Running 0        45h
quay-enterprise-config-app-86bbbcd446-mwmmg 1/1   Running 0        46h
quay-enterprise-redis-684b9d6f55-tx6w9      1/1   Running 0        46h
```
. **Get the URL for {productname}**: Type the following to get the hostname of the new {productname} installation:
+
```
$ oc get routes -n quay-enterprise quay-enterprise
NAME            HOST/PORT                                             PATH SERVICES                  PORT  TERMINATION WILDCARD
quay-enterprise quay-enterprise-quay-enterprise.apps.test.example.com      quay-enterprise-clusterip <all>             None
```
. **Start using {productname}**: Open the hostname in a web browser to start using {productname}.

[[add-clair-scanner]]
== Add Clair image scanning to {productname}

Setting up and deploying Clair image scanning for your
{productname} deployment requires the following basic steps:

* Setting up a database for Clair
* Creating authentication keys for Clair
* Deploying Clair

The following procedure assumes you already have a running
{productname} cluster on an OpenShift platform with the {productname} Setup
container running in your browser:

. **Create the Clair database**: This example configures a postgresql database to
use with the Clair image scanner. With the yaml files in the current directory,
review those files for possible modifications, then run the following:
+
```
$ oc create -f postgres-clair-storage.yaml
$ oc create -f postgres-clair-deployment.yaml
$ oc create -f postgres-clair-service.yaml
```
. **Check Clair database objects**: To view the Clair database objects, type:
+
```
$ oc get all | grep -i clair
pod/postgres-clair-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx 1/1      Running       0                     3m45s
deployment.apps/postgres-clair    1/1      1             1                     3m45s
service/postgres-clair            NodePort 172.30.193.64 <none> 5432:30680/TCP 159m
replicaset.apps/postgres-clair-xx 1        1             1                     3m45s

```
+
The output shows that the postgres-clair pod is running, postgres-clair was successfully
deployed, the postgres-clair service is available on the address and port shown, and 1
replica set of postgres-clair is active.

. **Open the {productname} Setup UI**: Reload the {productname} Setup UI and
select "Modify configuration for this cluster."

. **Enable Security Scanning**: Scroll to the Security Scanner section and
select the "Enable Security Scanning" checkbox. From the fields that appear you need to create an
authentication key and enter the security scanner endpoint. Here's how:
+
* **Generate key**: Click "Create Key" and then type a name for the Clair private key
and an optional expiration date (if blank, the key
never expires). Then select Generate Key.

* **Copy the Clair key and PEM file**: Save the Key ID (to a notepad or similar)
and download a copy of the Private Key PEM file (named security_scanner.pem)
by selecting "Download Private Key"
(if you lose this key, you will need to generate a new one).

. **Modify clair-config.yaml**: Return to the shell and the directory holding
your yaml files. Edit the `clair-config.yaml` file and modify the following values:
* **database.options.source**: Make sure the host, port, dbname, user, password, and ssl mode
match those values you set when you create the postgres database for Clair.
* **key_id**: Search for KEY_ID_HERE in this file and replace it with the contents of
the key you generated from the {productname} Setup screen in the Security Scanner section
(security_scanner.pam file).
* **private_key_path**: Identify the full path to the security_scanner.pem file you saved earlier.

. **Create the Clair config secret and service**: Run the following commands,
identifying the paths to your `clair-config.yaml` and `security_scanner.pem` files.
+
```
$ oc create secret generic clair-scanner-config-secret \
   --from-file=config.yaml=/path/to/clair-config.yaml \
   --from-file=security_scanner.pem=/path/to/security_scanner.pem
$ oc create -f clair-service.yaml
$ oc create -f clair-deployment.yaml
```
. **Get the clair-service endpoint**: In this example, the endpoint of
of clair-service would be http://172.30.133.227:6060:
+
```
$ oc get service clair-service
NAME            TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)             AGE
clair-service   ClusterIP   172.30.133.227   <none>        6060/TCP,6061/TCP   76s
```

. **Enter Security Scanner Endpoint**: Return to the {productname} Setup screen
and fill in the clair-service endpoint. For example, http://clair-service:6060

. **Deploy configuration**: Select to save the configuration, then deploy it when prompted.

A green check mark will appear on the screen when the deployment is done.
You can now start using Clair image scanning with {productname}.
For information on the data sources available with the Clair image scanner, see
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html/manage_red_hat_quay/clair-initial-setup#clair-sources[Using Clair data sources].

[[add-repo-mirroring]]
== Add repository mirroring {productname}
Enabling repository mirroring allows you to create container image repositories
on your {productname} cluster that exactly match the content of a selected
external registry, then sync the contents of those repositories on
a regular schedule and on demand.

To add the repository mirroring feature to your {productname} cluster:

* Run the repository mirroring worker. To do this, you start a quay pod with the
`repomirror` option.
* Select "Enable Repository Mirroring in the {productname} Setup tool.
* Log into your {productname} Web UI and begin creating mirrored repositories
as described in link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html-single/manage_red_hat_quay/index[Repository Mirroring in Red Hat Quay].

The following procedure assumes you already have a running
{productname} cluster on an OpenShift platform, with the {productname} Setup
container running in your browser:

[NOTE]
====
Instead of running repository mirroring in its own container, you
could start the quay application pod with the environment variable
`QUAY_OVERRIDE_SERVICES=repomirrorworker=true`. This causes the
repomirror worker to run inside the quay application pod instead
of as a separate container.
====

. **Start the repo mirroring worker**: Start the quay container in `repomirror` mode as follows:
+
```
$ oc create -f quay-enterprise-mirror.yaml
```
. **Log into config tool**: Log into the {productname} Setup Web UI (config tool).
. **Enable repository mirroring**: Scroll down the the Repository Mirroring section
and select the Enable Repository Mirroring check box, as shown here:
. **Select HTTPS and cert verification**: If you want to require HTTPS
communications and verify certificates during mirroring, select this check box.
image:repo_mirror_config.png[Enable mirroring and require HTTPS and verified certificates]
. **Save configuration**: Select the Save Configuration Changes button. Repository
mirroring should now be enabled on your {productname} cluster. Refer to
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html-single/manage_red_hat_quay/index[Repository Mirroring in {productname}] for details on setting up your own mirrored container image repositories.
[NOTE]
====
The server hostname you set with the config tools may not represent and endpoint
that can be used to copy images to a mirror configured for that server. In that case,
you can set a `REPO_MIRROR_SERVER_HOSTNAME` environment variable to identify the server’s
URL in a way that it can be reached by a skopeo copy command. 
====
