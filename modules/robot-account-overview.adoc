= {productname} Robot Account overview

Robot Accounts are used to set up automated access to the repositories in
your

registry. They are similar to {ocp} service accounts.

Setting up a Robot Account results in the following:

* Credentials are generated that are associated with the Robot Account. 

* Repositories and images that the Robot Account can push and pull images from are identified. 

* Generated credentials can be copied and pasted to use with different container clients, such as Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, Mesos, and so on, to access each defined repository.

ifeval::["{context}" == "quay-security"]
Robot Accounts can help secure your {productname} registry by offering various security advantages, such as the following:

* Specifying repository access.
* Granular permissions, such as `Read` (pull) or `Write` (push) access. They can also be equipped with `Admin` permissions if warranted.
* Designed for CI/CD pipelines, system integrations, and other automation tasks, helping avoid credential exposure in scripts, pipelines, or other environment variables.
* Robot Accounts use tokens instead of passwords, which provides the ability for an administrator to revoke the token in the event that it is compromised.

Each Robot Account is limited to a single user namespace or Organization. For example, the Robot Account could provide access to all repositories for the user `quayadmin`. However, it cannot provide access to repositories that are not in the user's list of repositories.

Robot Accounts can be created using the {productname} UI, or through the CLI using the {productname} API.
