= CVE ratings from the National Vulnerability Database

As of Clair v4.2, Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) enrichment data is now viewable in the {productname} UI. Additionally, Clair v4.2 adds CVSS scores from the National Vulnerability Database for detected vulnerabilities.

With this change, if the vulnerability has a CVSS score that is within 2 levels of the distribution score, the {productname} UI present's the distribution's score by default. For example:

This differs from the previous interface, which would only display the following information:
