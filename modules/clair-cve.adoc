= CVE ratings from the National Vulnerability Database

With Clair v4.2, CVSS enrichment data is now viewable in the Quay UI. 
Additionally, Clair v4.2 adds CVSS scores from the National Vulnerability Database for detected vulnerabilities. 

With this change, if the vulnerability has a CVSS score that is within 2 levels of the distribution score, the Quay UI present's the distro's score by default. For example:

This differs from the previous interface, which would only display the following information:
