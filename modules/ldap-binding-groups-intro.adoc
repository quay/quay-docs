= Bind team membership to specific LDAP groups 

With {productname}, team sync support can be enabled via the config application by clicking on the `Enable team synchronization support` button once  Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is selected as the internal authentication method:

The default time to sync groups is 60 minutes, but can be modified to any other time frame if needed. The first sync happens immediately after linking a team to a specific group. The last option enables any team admin, and not just super users, to sync groups. 

Once {productname} is configured and restarted with the new settings, open up `org account settings` and proceed to `Teams`. Create a new team, or use an existing one, and click on `Enable Directory Synchronization` button. You will need to enter a distinguished name of the group relative to your base DN. For example: 

----
cn=quayusers,ou=cloud
----

If binding to the group goes correctly, {productname} will display the group's distinguished name and the "last updated" status on the page. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
Once sync is enabled, adding users to the group is no longer possible. It becomes read only.
====

Users that are added to the LDAP group will automatically be added to the team as well. Robot accounts can still be added to the group directly.
