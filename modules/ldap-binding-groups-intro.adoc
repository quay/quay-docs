= Bind team membership to specific LDAP groups 

With {productname}, team sync support can be enabled via the config application by clicking on the `Enable team synchronization support` button once  Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is selected as the internal authentication method:

The default time to sync groups is 60 minutes, but can be modified to any other time frame if needed. The first sync happens immediately after linking a team to a specific group. The last option enables any team admin, and not just super users, to sync groups. 

In order to enable team sync, users must configure their teams by clicking on the `Enable Directory Synchronization` button in the *Teams* tab. A distinguished name is required relative to the base DN. For example: 

----
cn=quayusers,ou=cloud
----

If binding to the group goes correctly, {productname} will display the group's distinguished name and the "last updated" status on the page. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
Once sync is enabled, adding users to the group is no longer possible. It becomes read only.
====

Users that are added to the LDAP group will automatically be added to the team as well. Robot accounts can still be added to the group directly.
