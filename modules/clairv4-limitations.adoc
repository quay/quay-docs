= Clair v4 limitations

The following limitations are currently being addressed by the development team: 

* As of Clair v4, both operating system level and programming language packages are covered. Programming language packages are currently limited to Python, however support for other languages will be added in the future. 

* There is currently limited multi-arch support on Clair v4, which works for package managers like `rpm`, `yum`, and `dnf` that compensates for differences in endianess. 

* Clair v4 does not currently support Microsoft Windows images. 

* Clair v4 does not currently support slim/scratch container images.
