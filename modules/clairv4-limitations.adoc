= Clair v4 limitations

The following limitations are currently being addressed by the development team: 

* As of Clair v4, both operating system level and programming language packages are covered. The latter is currently limited to Python, however support for other languages will be added in the future. 

* There is currently limited multi-arch support on Clair v4, which works for package managers like `rpm`, `yum`, and `dnf` that compensates for differences in endianess. 

* Clair v4 does not currently support MSFT Windows images. 

* Clair v4 does not currently support slim/scratch container images.
