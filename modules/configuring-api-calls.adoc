= Enabling browser-based API calls in {productname}

By default, {productname} accepts CURL requests from the command line. However, if you want to enable API access from a browser extension such as Postman, or a browser interface such as Swagger, you must disable `BROWSER_API_CALLS_XHR_ONLY` in your `config.yaml` file.

.Procedure

. In your {productname} `config.yaml` file, set `BROWSER_API_CALLS_XHR_ONLY` to `false`. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
BROWSER_API_CALLS_XHR_ONLY: false
# ...
----

. Restart your {productname} deployment.
