= Clair severity mapping

Clair offers a comprehensive approach to vulnerability assessment and management. One of its essential features is the normalization of security databases' severity strings. This process streamlines the assessment of vulnerability severities by mapping them to a predefined set of values. Through this mapping, clients can efficiently react to vulnerability severities without the need to decipher the intricacies of each security database's unique severity strings. These mapped severity strings align with those found within the respective security databases, ensuring consistency and accuracy in vulnerability assessment.
