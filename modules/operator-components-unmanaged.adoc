= Using unmanaged components for dependencies

[role="_abstract"]
Unmanaged components are {productname} dependencies such as PostgreSQL, Redis, or object storage that you deploy and maintain outside of the Operator's control. You use unmanaged components to integrate existing infrastructure or meet specific configuration requirements.

[NOTE]
====
If you are using an unmanaged PostgreSQL database, and the version is PostgreSQL 10, it is highly recommended that you upgrade to PostgreSQL 13. PostgreSQL 10 had its final release on November 10, 2022 and is no longer supported. For more information, see the link:https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/[PostgreSQL Versioning Policy].
