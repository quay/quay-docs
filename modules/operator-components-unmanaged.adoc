= Using unmanaged components for dependencies

If you have existing components such as Postgres, Redis or object storage that you would like to use with Quay, you first configure them within the Quay configuration bundle (`config.yaml`) and then reference the bundle in your `QuayRegistry` (as a Kubernetes `Secret`) while indicating which components are unmanaged.


[NOTE]
====
The Quay config editor can also be used to create or modify an existing config bundle and simplifies the process of updating the Kubernetes `Secret`, especially for multiple changes.  When Quay's configuration is changed via the config editor and sent to the Operator, the Quay deployment will be updated to reflect the new configuration.
