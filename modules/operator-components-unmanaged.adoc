= Using unmanaged components for dependencies

If you have existing components such as PostgreSQL, Redis, or object storage that you want to use with {productname}, you first configure them within the {productname} configuration bundle (`config.yaml`). Then, they must be referenced in your `QuayRegistry` bundle (as a Kubernetes `Secret`) while indicating which components are unmanaged.

[NOTE]
====
The {productname} config editor can also be used to create or modify an existing config bundle and simplifies the process of updating the Kubernetes `Secret`, especially for multiple changes. When {productname}'s configuration is changed by the config editor and sent to the {productname} Operator, the deployment is updated to reflect the new configuration.
