The config tool also displays a list of any uploaded certificates. Once you upload your custom SSL cert, it will appear in the list:

//As an alternative to using the config tool, you can place the custom certs in a folder named `extra_ca_certs` under the {productname} configdirectory where the `config.yaml` is located.
