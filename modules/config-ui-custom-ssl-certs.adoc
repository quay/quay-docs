The config tool can be used to load custom certificates to facilitate access to resources like external databases. Select the custom certs to be uploaded, ensuring that they are in PEM format, with an extension `.crt`.

The config tool also displays a list of any uploaded certificates. After you upload your custom SSL/TLS cert, it will appear in the list. For example:

//As an alternative to using the config tool, you can place the custom certs in a folder named `extra_ca_certs` under the {productname} configdirectory where the `config.yaml` is located.
