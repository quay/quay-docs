= Configuring port mapping for {productname}

You can use port mappings to expose ports on the host and then use these ports in combination with the host IP address or host name to navigate to the configuration tool endpoint.

+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ip a
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]

---
    link/ether 6c:6a:77:eb:09:f1 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.1.132/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute wlp82s0
---

. Add the IP address and a local hostname, for example, `quay-server.example.com` to your `/etc/hosts` file that will be used to reach the configuration tool endpoint. You can confirm that the IP address and hostname have been added to the `/etc/hosts` file by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat /etc/hosts
