= Configuring port mapping for {productname}

You can use port mappings to expose ports on the host and then use these ports in combination with the host IP address or host name to navigate to the {productname} endpoint.

.Procedure 

. Enter the following command to obtain your static IP address for your host system:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ip a
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]

---
    link/ether 6c:6a:77:eb:09:f1 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.1.132/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute wlp82s0
---
----

. Add the IP address and a local hostname, for example, `quay-server.example.com` to your `/etc/hosts` file that will be used to reach the {productname} endpoint. You can confirm that the IP address and hostname have been added to the `/etc/hosts` file by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat /etc/hosts
