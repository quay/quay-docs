[id="new-features-and-enhancements-312"]
== {productname} new features and enhancements

The following updates have been made to {productname}.

[id="api-token-ownership"]
=== API token ownership

Previously, when a {productname} organization owner created an API OAuth token, and that API OAuth token was used by another organization member, the action was logged to the creator of the token. This was undesirable for auditing purpose, notably in restricted environments where only dedicated registry administrators are organization owners. 

With this release, organization administrators can now assign OAuth API tokens to be created by other user's with specific permissions. This allows the audit logs to be reflected accurately when the token is used by a user that has no organization administrative permissions to create an OAuth API token.

For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/use_red_hat_quay/index#reassigning-oauth-access-token[Reassigning an OAuth access token].
