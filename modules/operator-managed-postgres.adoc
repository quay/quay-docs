= Using the managed PostgreSQL


* Database backups should be performed regularly using either the supplied tools on the Postgres image or your own backup infrastructure.  The Operator does not currently ensure the Postgres database is backed up.
* Restoring the Postgres database from a backup must be done using Postgres tools and procedures.  Be aware that your Quay `Pods` should not be running while the database restore is in progress.
* Database disk space is allocated automatically by the Operator with 50 GiB. This number represents a usable amount of storage for most small to medium {productname} installations but may not be sufficient for your use cases. Resizing the database volume is currently not handled by the Operator.
