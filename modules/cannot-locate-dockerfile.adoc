= Unable to locate specified Dockerfile

When building an image, the following error is returned: `A build step failed: API error (500): Cannot locate specified Dockerfile: Dockerfile`. This occurs for one of two reasons:

* *The `.dockerignore` file contains the Dockerfile.* Unlike Docker Hub, the Dockerfile is part of the Build Context on {productname}. The Dockerfile must not appear in the `.dockerignore` file. Remove the Dockerfile from the `.dockerignore` file to resolve the issue. 

* *The build trigger is incorrect.* Verify the Dockerfile location and the branch or tag value specified in the build trigger.
