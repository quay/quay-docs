= Access control

{productname} provides both Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and Fine-Grained Access Control, and has team features that allow for limited access control to repositories organizations and user privileges. {productname} access control features also provide support for dispersed organizations.

== Repository organizations and users

{productname} repository organizations provide a way to share repositories under a common namespace that does not belong to a single user. These organizations allow repositories to be used in a shared setting, for example, by a company. 

The following is a brief overview of the organization's main page: 

* **Managing teams**: Teams can be managed from the organization's main page.
* **Creating a team**: Click the `Create Team` button on the organization main page. 
* **Team Global Permissions**: Teams have defined global permissions in the organization. 
* **Managing team members**: Team members can be managed by clicking on a team's name in the organization's main page. 
* **Defined permissions**:

=== {productname} users

A new {productname} user can set up an account at www.quay.io. Usernames must be unique, and they cannot be changed once invited to an organization. After a user account is setup, options to sign in via Google or GitHub can be added. 

User accounts allow individuals to log in through the {productname} UI or a client, such as `docker login` or `podman login`. 

[NOTE]
====
Because `docker login` via the CLI stores passwords in plaintext, we recommend generating an encrypted version of the password. 
====

Each user automatically gets their own `user namespace`, for example, quay.example.com/user/<username>. 

[NOTE]
====
User namespaces are different from Quay organizations. There are no teams, usage logs, default permissions, or OAuth applications. By comparison, organizations are listed under quay.example.com/organization. 
====

Users who are not members of an organization can be added to the repository and given permissions. These `external` users are marked with a special character inside of the `Users and Robot Permissions` section under the `Repository Settings` tab. They are also shown under the `Collaborators View` tab on on the organization level of the `Teams and Membership` page. 

=== {productname} robot accounts

Robot accounts are named tokens that hold credentials for accessing external repositories. By assigning credentials to a robot, that robot can be used
across multiple mirrored repositories that need to access the same external registry.

Robot accounts are managed inside of the `Robot Accounts` tab. They can only belong to one organization, but can be assigned to multiple Teams. 

[NOTE]
====
Teams and users can belong to multiple organizations. 
====

For more information on robot accounts, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3.5/html-single/manage_red_hat_quay/index#working-with-mirrored-repo[Working with mirrored repositories].

=== {productname} Super users 

`Super users` are a group of {productname} users with enhanced access and privileges, including: 

* Super user API calls that are not visible or accessible to normal users. 
* Access to the `Super User Admin Panel`, which allows users to
** Change a user's email address, password, delete, or disable users.
** Rename, delete, or take ownership of an organization. 
** Change expiration time, rename, or delete service keys such as Clair.
** Access to global and registry-wide usage, or audit, logs. 
** Create and send globally visible user messages. 

Primary super users are created during the initial {productname} configuration, and more can be created after configuration is complete. 

[NOTE]
====
Super users cannot delete repositories or organizations without taking ownership of them first. 
====

For more information on creating super users, see xref:proc_deploy_quay_common_superuser[Red Hat Quay super user]

== Permissions

Organizations are organized into a set of Teams and can provide access to a subset of the repositories under that namespace. Permissions for users within an organization can be set for individuals, teams, and robot accounts.

[NOTE]
====
Permissions are only applied to new users and teams when a new repository is created. 
====

=== Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

{productname} offers three types of permissions: 

* `Read`, which allows users, robots, and teams to pull images
* `Write`, which allows users, robots, and teams to push images
* `Admin`, which provides users, robots, and teams with administrative privileges

[NOTE]
====
Administrative users can delegate new permissions for existing users and teams, change existing permissions, and revoke permissions when necessary 
====

Permissions can be delegated across the entire organization and on specific repositories. For example, `Read` permissions can be set to a specific team within the organization, while `Admin` permissions can be given to all users across all repositories within the organization.  

=== Fine Grained Access Control

{productname} allow users to integrate their existing identity infrastructure and use a fine-grained permissions system to map their organizational structure and grant access to whole teams to manage specific repositories. 

{productname} is supported by the following authentication providers: 

* Built-in Database Authentication
* Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) authentication and _sync
* External OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider 
* OpenStack Keystone 

// Wondering if we could cut the following sections and refer to material already in the docs. For example, we could use the above bullet points on LDAP and link to https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3.4/html/manage_red_hat_quay/ldap-authentication-setup-for-quay-enterprise. I just copied what was in the tech deck. 

==== Bind team membership to specific LDAP groups 

With {productname}, team sync support can be enabled via the config application by clicking on the `Enable team synchronization support` button once  Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is selected as the internal authentication method:

// insert images

The default time to sync groups is 60 minutes, but can be modified to any other time frame if needed. The first sync happens immediately after linking a team to a specific group. The last option enables any team admin, and not just super users, to sync groups. 

Once {productname} is configured and restarted with the new settings, open up `org account settings` and proceed to `Teams`. Create a new team, or use an existing one, and click on `Enable Directory Synchronization` button. You will need to enter a distinguished name of the group relative to your base DN. For example: 

----
cn=quayusers,ou=cloud
----

If binding to the group goes correctly, {productname} will display the group's distinguished name and the "last updated" status on the page. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
Once sync is enabled, adding users to the group is no longer possible. It becomes read only.
====

Users that are added to the LDAP group will automatically be added to the team as well. Robot accounts can still be added to the group directly. 

==== LDAP filtering
 
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an open, vendor neutral, industry standard application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an IP network. {productname} supports using LDAP as an identity provider. {productname} users can now apply additional filters for lookup queries if (LDAP) / AD authentication is used. For information on LDAP authentication setup for {productname}, see *include link*. 
 
==== {productname} and Red Hat SSO / Keycloak

Quay Enterprise can support authentication via OpenID Connect (OIDC). Red Hat Single Sign On (SSO) is an OIDC provider that allows administrators to have a seamless authentication integration between Quay Enterprise and other application platforms such as Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

{productname} and Red Hat SSO / Keycloak requires that TLS/SSL is properly configured to proceed with setup. Red Hat SSO supports many different types of OIDC. Quay Enterprise, however, only supports OIDC clients configured for link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3496181[Confidential Client Credentials]. For more information configuring Red Hat SSO, see link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3566061[Quay Enterprise with Red Hat Single Sign On / Keycloak].
