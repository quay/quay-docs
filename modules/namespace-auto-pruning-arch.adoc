= Namespace auto-pruning architecture

For the namespace auto-pruning feature, two distinct database tables within a database schema were created: one for `namespaceautoprunepolicy` and another for `autoprunetaskstatus`. An auto-prune worker carries out the configured policies.

[id="namespaceautoprunepolicy-database-table"]
== Namespace auto prune policy database table

The `namespaceautoprunepolicy` database table holds the policy configuration for a single namespace. There is only one entry per namespace, but there is support for multiple rows per `namespace_id`. The `policy` field holds the policy details, such as `{method: "creation_date", olderThan: "2w"}` or `{method: "number_of_tags",  numTags: 100}`.

|===
| Field | Type |Attributes | Description

| `uuid` | character varying (225) | Unique, indexed | Unique identifier for this policy

| `namespace_id` | Integer | Foreign Key |Namespace that the policy falls under

| `policy` | text | JSON | Policy configuration

== Auto-prune task status database table

The `autoprunetaskstatus` table registers tasks to be executed by the auto-prune worker. Tasks are executed within the context of a single namespace. Only one task per namespace exists.

|===
| Field | Type |Attributes | Description
| `namespace_id` | Integer | Foreign Key | Namespace that this task belongs to

| `last_ran_ms` | Big Integer (bigint) | Nullable, indexed | Last time that the worker executed the policies for this namespace

| `status` | text | Nullable | Details from the last execution task

== Auto-prune worker

The following sections detail information about the auto-prune worker. 

[id="auto-prune-task-creation"]
=== Auto-prune-task-creation

When a new policy is created in the `namespaceautoprunepolicy` database table, a row is also created in the `autoprunetask` table. This is done in the same transaction. The auto-prune worker uses the entry in the `autoprunetask` table to identify which namespace it should execute policies for. 

[id="auto-prune-worker-execution"]
=== Auto-prune worker execution

The auto-pruning worker is an asynchronous job that executes configured policies. Its workflow is based on values in the `autoprunetask` table. When a task begins, the following occurs: 

* The auto-prune worker starts on a set interval, which defaults at 30 seconds. 
* The auto-prune worker selects a row from `autoprunetask` with the least, or null, `last_ran_ms` and `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`. 
** A null `last_ran_ms` indicates that the task was never ran. 
** A task that hasn't been ran in he longest amount of time, or has never been run at all, is prioritized. 

* The auto-prune worker obtains the policy configuration from the `namespaceautoprunepolicy` table.
** If no policy configuration exists, the entry from `autoprunetask` is deleted for this namespace and the procedure stops immediately. 

* The auto-prune worker begins a paginated loop of all repositories under the organization. 
** The auto-prune worker determines much pruning method to use based on `policy.method`. 
* The auto-prune worker executes the pruning method with the policy configuration retrieved earlier. 
** For pruning by the number of tags: the auto-pruner worker gets the number of currently active tags sorted by creation date, and deletes the older tags to the configured number.
** For pruning by date: the auto-pruner worker gets the active tags older than the specified time span and any tags returned are deleted. 

* The auto-prune worker adds audit logs of the tags deleted.

* The `last_ran_ms` gets updated after a row from `autoprunetask` is selected. 

* The auto-prune worker ends.
