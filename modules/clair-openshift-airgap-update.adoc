=  Manually updating the vulnerability databases for Clair in an air-gapped OpenShift cluster

Clair utilizes packages called `updaters` that encapsulate the logic of fetching and parsing different vulnerability databases. Clair supports running updaters in a different environment and importing the results. This is aimed at supporting installations that disallow the Clair cluster from talking to the Internet directly. 

To manually update the vulnerability databases for Clair in an air-gapped OpenShift cluster, use the following steps:

* Obtain the `clairctl` program
* Retrieve the Clair config
* Use `clairctl` to export the updaters bundle from a Clair instance that has access to the internet
* Update the Clair config in the air-gapped OpenShift cluster to allow access to the Clair database 
* Transfer the updaters bundle from the system with internet access, to make it available inside the air-gapped environment 
* Use `clairctl` to import the updaters bundle into the Clair instance for the air-gapped OpenShift cluster
