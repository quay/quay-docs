= Console monitoring and alerting

{productname} provides support for monitoring instances that were deployed by using the {productname} Operator, from inside the {ocp} console. The new monitoring features include a Grafana dashboard, access to individual metrics, and alerting to notify for frequently restarting `Quay` pods.

[NOTE]
====
To enable the monitoring features, the {productname} Operator must be installed in *All Namespaces* mode.

* Rates of pulls and pushes, and authentication requests
* API request rate
* Latencies

Select a sample metric, for example, `quay_org_rows`:

This metric shows the number of organizations in the registry. It is also directly surfaced in the dashboard.

[id="operator-alerting"]
== Alerting

An alert is raised if the `Quay` pods restart too often. The alert can be configured by accessing the *Alerting* rules tab from *Monitoring* -> *Alerting* in the console UI and searching for the Quay-specific alert:
