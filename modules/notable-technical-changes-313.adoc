= {productname} 3.13 notable technical changes

Clair now requires its PostgreSQL database to be version 15. For standalone {productname} deployments, administrators must manually migrate their database over from PostgreSQL version 13 to version 15. For more information about this procedure, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/upgrade_red_hat_quay/index#upgrading-clair-postgresql-database[Upgrading the Clair PostgreSQL database].

For {productname-ocp} deployments, this update is automatically handled by the Operator so long as your Clair PostgreSQL database is currently using version 13.
