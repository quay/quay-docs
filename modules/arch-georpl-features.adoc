= Geo-replication features

* When geo-replication is configured, container image pushes will be written to the preferred storage engine for that {productname} instance. This is typically the nearest storage backend within the region.

* After the initial push, image data will be replicated in the background to other storage engines.

* The list of replication locations is configurable and those can be different storage backends.

* An image pull will always use the closest available storage engine, to maximize pull performance.

* If replication has not been completed yet, the pull will use the source storage backend instead.
