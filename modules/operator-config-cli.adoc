= Configuring Quay on OpenShift 

Once deployed, you can configure the Quay application by editing the Quay configuration bundle secret `spec.configBundleSecret` and you can also change the managed status of components in the `spec.components` object of the QuayRegistry resource   

Alternatively, you can use the config editor UI to configure the Quay application, as described in the section xref:operator-config-ui[].
