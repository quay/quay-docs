= Building container images

Building container images involves creating a blueprint for a containerized application. Blueprints rely on base images from other public repositories that define how the application should be installed and configured.

ifeval::["{context}" == "quay-io"]
[NOTE]
====
Because blueprints rely on images from other public repositories, they might be subject to rate limiting. Consequently, your build _could_ fail.

endif::[]

ifeval::["{context}" == "quay-io"]
{quayio}

ifeval::["{context}" == "use-quay"]

endif::[]
supports the ability to build Docker and Podman container images. This functionality is valuable for developers and organizations who rely on container and container orchestration.

ifeval::["{context}" == "quay-io"]
On {quayio}, this feature works the same across both free, and paid, tier plans.

[NOTE]
====
{quayio} limits the number of simultaneous builds that a single user can submit at one time.

[id="build-contexts"]
== Build contexts

When building an image with Docker or Podman, a directory is specified to become the _build context_. This is true for both manual Builds and Build triggers, because the Build that is created by
ifeval::["{context}" == "quay-io"]
{quayio}
endif::[]
ifeval::["{context}" == "use-quay"]
{productname}
endif::[]
is not different than running `docker build` or `podman build` on your local machine. 

ifeval::["{context}" == "quay-io"]
{quayio}
endif::[]
ifeval::["{context}" == "use-quay"]
{productname}
endif::[]
Build contexts are always specified in the _subdirectory_ from the Build setup, and fallback to the root of the Build source if a directory is not specified.

When a build is triggered, 
ifeval::["{context}" == "quay-io"]
{quayio}
endif::[]
ifeval::["{context}" == "use-quay"]
{productname}
endif::[]
Build workers clone the Git repository to the worker machine, and then enter the Build context before conducting a Build. 

For Builds based on `.tar` archives, Build workers extract the archive and enter the Build context. For example:

.Extracted Build archive 
[source,terminal]
----
example
├── .git
├── Dockerfile
├── file
└── subdir
    └── Dockerfile
----

Imagine that the _Extracted Build archive_ is the directory structure got a Github repository called *example.* If no subdirectory is specified in the Build trigger setup, or when manually starting the Build, the Build operates in the example directory. 

If a subdirectory is specified in the Build trigger setup, for example, `subdir`, only the Dockerfile within it is visible to the Build. This means that you cannot use the `ADD` command in the Dockerfile to add `file`, because it is outside of the Build context. 

Unlike Docker Hub, the Dockerfile is part of the Build context on
ifeval::["{context}" == "quay-io"]
{quayio}.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{context}" == "use-quay"]
{productname}.
endif::[]
As a result, it must not appear in the `.dockerignore` file.

[id="understanding-tag-naming-build-triggers"]
== Tag naming for Build triggers

Custom tags are available for use in
ifeval::["{context}" == "quay-io"]
{quayio}.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{context}" == "use-quay"]
{productname}. 
endif::[]

One option is to include any string of characters assigned as a tag for each built image. Alternatively, you can use the following tag templates on the *Configure Tagging* section of the build trigger to tag images with information from each commit:

image:custom-tagging.png[Configure Tagging]

* *${commit}*: Full SHA of the issued commit
* *${parsed_ref.branch}*: Branch information (if available)
* *${parsed_ref.tag}*: Tag information (if available)
* *${parsed_ref.remote}*: The remote name
* *${commit_info.date}*: Date when the commit was issued
* *${commit_info.author.username}*: Username of the author of the commit
* *${commit_info.short_sha}*: First 7 characters of the commit SHA
* *${committer.properties.username}*: Username of the committer

This list is not complete, but does contain the most useful options for tagging purposes. You can find the complete tag template schema on link:https://github.com/quay/quay/blob/abfde5b9d2cf7d7145e68a00c9274011b4fe0661/buildtrigger/basehandler.py#L96-L195[this page].

[id="build-trigger"]
== Build triggers

Build triggers invoke builds whenever the triggered condition is met, for example, a source control push, link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/use_red_hat_quay/#webhook[creating a webhook call], and so on. 

[id="creating-a-build-trigger"]
=== Creating a Build trigger

Use the following procedure to create a Build trigger. 

.Prerequisites

* You have navigated to the *Builds* page of your repository. 

.Procedure 

. On the *Builds* page, click *Create Build Trigger*. 

. Select the desired platform, for example, Github, BitBucket, Gitlab, or use a custom Git repository. For this example, we are using Github.

. If prompted, confirm access to your account.

. When prompted, select an organization. You can filter namespaces by including text in the *Filter namespaces...* box. Alternatively, you can scroll your namespaces by clicking the directional arrows. If the organization that you are trying to select is not listed, click *Connections wih Quay Container Registry* to request, or grant yourself, access. 

. Click *Continue* after you have selected an organization. 

. When prompted, select a repository. Then, click *Continue*. 

. Configure the trigger by selecting one of the following options:

.. *Trigger for all branches and tags (default1)*. By selecting this option, a container image for each commit across all branches and tags is created. 

.. *Trigger only on branches and tags matching a regular expression*. By selecting this option, only container images for a subset of branches and/or tags are built. 

. Click *Continue*. 

. When prompted, configure the tagging options by selecting one of, or both of, the following options:
+
* *Tag manifest with the branch or tag name*. When selecting this option, the built manifest the name of the branch or tag for the git commit are tagged.
+
* *Add `latest` tag if on default branch*. When selecting this option, the built manifest with latest if the build occurred on the default branch for the repository are tagged. 

. Optional. Add a custom tagging template. There are multiple tag templates that you can enter here, including using short SHA IDs, timestamps, author names, committer, and branch names from the commit as tags. For more information, see "Understanding tag naming for Build triggers".

. Click *Continue*.

. When prompted, select the location of the Dockerfile to be built when the trigger is invoked. If the Dockerfile is located at the root of the git repository and named Dockerfile, enter */Dockerfile* as the Dockerfile path.

. Click *Continue*.

. When prompted, select the context for the Docker build. If the Dockerfile is located at the root of the Git repository, enter `/` as the build context directory.

. Check for any verification warnings. If necessary, fix the issues before clicking *Continue*. 

. When prompted with *Ready to go!*, click *Continue*. You are redirected to a confirmation page.

. Save the SSH Public Key, then click *Return to <organization_name>/<repository_name>*. You are redirected to the *Builds* page of your repository. 

. On the *Builds* page, you now have a Build trigger. For example:
+
image:build-trigger-example.png[Example Build trigger]

[id="manually-triggering-a-build-trigger"]
=== Manually triggering a Build

Builds can be triggered manually by using the following procedure.

.Procedure

. On the *Builds* page, click the _cog wheel_, or *Options* icon, and select *Run Trigger Now*. 

. When prompted, click the dropdown menu to specify a branch or tag, then click *Start Build*. 
+
After the build starts, you can see the Build ID on the *Repository Builds* page.
