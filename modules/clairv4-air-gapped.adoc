= Air-gapped Clair v4

{productname} 3.4 and later and Clair v4 are supported in disconnected environments. By default, Clair v4 will attempt to run automated updates against Red Hat servers. When Clair v4 in network environments is disconnected from the internet:

* The Clair v4 auto-update is disabled in the Clair `config` bundle.
* On a system with internet access, the vulnerability database updates is performed manually and exported to a disk.
* The on-disk data is then transferred to the target system with offline media. It is then manually imported.
