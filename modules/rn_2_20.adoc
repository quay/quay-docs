== Version 2.2.0

Release Date: March 31, 2017

[NOTE]
====
This release contains a migration that adds a new feature to the build system. This requires shutting down the entire cluster including builders and running one instance to migrate the database forward. You must use a v2.2.0 builder with a v2.2.0 Quay cluster.
