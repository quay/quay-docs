= Adding additional Certificate Authorities to {productname-ocp}

On {productname-ocp}, the `extra_ca_certs` configuration field is is used to populate additional Certificate Authorities (CAs) into the CA directory, which then adds the CAs into the system trust bundle. These certificates are used by {productname} to verify SSL/TLS connections with external services like LDAP, OIDC, and storage systems. 

When deploying or redeploying {productname-ocp}, you can add one, or multiple, CAs into the CA directory to ensure that external services are properly secured and validated. On {productname-ocp} deployments, you must manually add the `extra_ca_certs` configuration field to your `config.yaml` file and re-upload the `config.yaml` to {ocp}.

The following procedures show you how to download your existing configuration file, add additional CAs to your {productname-ocp} deployment, and then re-upload the configuration file.
