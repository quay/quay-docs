== Installing Podman

This document uses Podman for creating and deploying containers. 

For more information on Podman and related technologies, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html-single/building_running_and_managing_containers/index[Building, running, and managing Linux containers on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9].

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you do not have Podman installed on your system, the use of equivalent Docker commands might be possible, however this is not recommended. Docker has not been tested with {productname} {producty}, and will be deprecated in a future release. Podman is recommended for highly available, production quality deployments of {productname} {producty}. 
====

Use the following procedure to install Podman.

.Procedure

+
[source,terminal]
