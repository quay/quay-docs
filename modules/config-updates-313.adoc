The following sections detail new configuration fields added in {productname} 3.13.

[id="disabling-pushes-configuration-field"]
== Disabling pushes to the {productname} registry

The following configuration field has been added to disable the push of new content to the registry.

|===
| Field | Type | Description 

|*DISABLE_PUSHES* |Boolean | Disables pushes of new content to the registry while retaining all other functionality. Differs from `read-only` mode because database is not set as `read-only`. When `DISABLE_PUSHES` is set to `True`, the {productname} garbage collector is disabled. As a result, when `PERMANENTLY_DELETE_TAGS` is enabled, using the {productname} UI to permanently delete a tag does not result in the immediate deletion of a tag. Instead, the image stays in the backend storage until `DISABLE_PUSHES` is set to `False`, which re-enables the garbage collector. {productname} administrators should be aware of this caveat when using `DISABLE_PUSHES` and `PERMANENTLY_DELETE_TAGS` together. +

 **Default:** False
