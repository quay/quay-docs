= Creating a mirrored repository
The steps shown in this section assume you already have enabled repository mirroring in the configuration for your {productname} cluster and that you have a deployed a  mirroring worker. 

To mirror a repository from an external container registry, create a new repository, typically with the same name as the target repo, for example, `quay-rhel8`. 


== Repository mirroring settings

In the Settings tab, set the Repository State to `Mirror`:

In the Mirror tab, enter the details for connecting to the external registry, along with the tags, scheduling and access information.

* **Registry Location:** The external repository you want to mirror, for example, `registry.redhat.io/quay/quay-rhel8`
* **Tags:** This field is required. You may enter a comma-separated list of individual tags or
tag patterns. (See _Tag Patterns_ section for details.)
+
[NOTE]
====
In order for Quay to get the list of tags in the remote repository, one of the following requirements must be met:
  
* An image with the "latest" tag must exist in the remote repository _OR_
* At least one explicit tag, without pattern matching, must exist in the list of tags that you specify
====
* **Start Date:** The date on which mirroring begins. The current date and time is used by default.
* **Sync Interval:** Defaults to syncing every 24 hours. You can change that based on hours or days.
* **Robot User:** Create a new robot account or choose an existing robot account to do the mirroring.
* **Username:** The username for accessing the external registry holding the repository you are mirroring.
* **Password:** The password associated with the Username. Note that the password
cannot include characters that require an escape character (\).


== Advanced settings

In the Advanced Settings section, configure TLS and proxy, if required:

* **Verify TLS:** Check this box if you want to verify the authenticity of the external registry.
Uncheck this box if, for example, you set up {productname} for testing with a self-signed certificate
or no certificate.
* **HTTP Proxy:** Identify the HTTP proxy server needed to access the remote site, if one is required.
* **HTTPS Proxy:** Identify the HTTPS proxy server needed to access the remote site, if one is required.
* **No Proxy:** List of locations that do not require proxy

== Synchronize now

To perform an immediate mirroring operation, press the Sync Now button on the repository's Mirroring tab. The logs are available on the Usage Logs tab:

When the mirroring is complete, the images will appear in the Tags tab:
