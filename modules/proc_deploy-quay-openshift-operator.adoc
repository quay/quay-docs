= Deploying {productname}
[id="deploy-quay-openshift-operator"]

// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

This procedure:

* Installs the {productname} Operator on OpenShift from the OperatorHub
* Deploys a {productname} cluster on OpenShift with the Quay Operator

You have the option of changing dozens of settings before deploying the
{productname} Operator.
The Operator automates the entire start-up process,
by-passing the {productname} config tool. You can choose to
skip the Operator's automated configuration and use the config tool directly.

As of {productname} 3.3, the Quay Setup Operator is now simply called the Quay Operator.
Features have been added to this operator to allow it to be used to
maintain and update your {productname} cluster after deployment.
Updates can be done directly through the Operator or using the {productname} Config Tool.

.Prerequisites

* An OpenShift 4.2 (or later) cluster
* Cluster-scope admin privilege to the OpenShift cluster

== Production deployments

For a non-production deployment, you can take the defaults and get a {productname}
cluster up and running quickly. For a production deployment, you should go through
all the configuration options described later in this document. Of those, however,
you should certainly consider at least the following:

* **Superuser password**: Change the default superuser password.
* **Config tool password**: Change the {productname} Config Tool password from the default.
* **Quay image**: If available, replace the quay image associated with the current
Operator with a later quay image.
* **Replica count**: Based on your expected demand, increase the replica count to
set how many instances of the quay container will run.
* **Memory request**: Choose how much memory to assign to the quay container,
based on expected demand.
* **CPU request**: Select the amount of CPU you want assigned, based on expected demand.
* **Quay database**: Consider using an existing PostgreSQL database that is 
outside of the OpenShift cluster and one that has commercial support.
* **Storage backend**: Choose a reliable and supported storage backend. Local storage
and NFS storage are not supported for production deployments!
* **Certificates**: Supply your own certificates to communicate with {productname},
as well as to access other services, such as storage and LDAP services.

== Install the {productname} Operator

. From the OpenShift console, select Operators -> OperatorHub, then select
the {productname} Operator. If there is more than one, be sure to use the
Red Hat certified Operator and not the community version.

. Select Install. The Operator Subscription page appears.

. Choose the following then select Subscribe:

* Installation Mode: Select a specific namespace to install to

* Update Channel: Choose the update channel (only one may be available)

* Approval Strategy: Choose to approve automatic or manual updates

. Select Subscribe.

== Deploy a {productname} ecosystem

. See the
link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3533201[Accessing Red Hat Quay]
article for information on getting credentials needed to obtain the
quay container from Quay.io. Then put those credentials in a file. In this example, we create a
config.json in the local directory.

. Create a secret that includes your credentials, as follows:
+
```
$ oc create secret generic redhat-pull-secret \
    --from-file=".dockerconfigjson=config.json" --type='kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson'
```

. Create a custom resource file (in this example, named `quayecosystem_cr.yaml`) or copy one from the link:https://github.com/redhat-cop/quay-operator/tree/master/deploy/examples[quay-operator examples] page. This example uses default settings:
+
```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
```

. Go through the `Customizing
your {productname} cluster` section to choose configuration settings you want to change.

. Deploy the Quay ecosystem from your custom
resource file as follows:
+
```
$ oc create -f quayecosystem_cr.yaml
```
+
Deploying the custom resource automatically creates and configures
the {productname} cluster, which includes the {productname}, PostgreSQL,
and Redis services.

. To check the status of your {productname} cluster, log in to your
OpenShift web console, select Projects, then select the `quay-enterprise`
project to see the following:
+
image:quay-setup-operator-openshift.png[The {productname} Setup Operator deployed in OpenShift]

If {productname} is running, here is how to get started using
your {productname} configuration:

* Get the route to your new  {productname} cluster as follows:
+
```
$ oc get route
NAME                       HOST/PORT
       PATH                     SERVICES PORT TERMINATION           WILDCARD
example-quayecosystem-quay example-quayecosystem-quay-default.example.com
       example-quayecosystem-quay        8443 passthrough/Redirect  None

```

* Using that route, log in with the superuser credentials (Username: `quay` and Password: `password` or change credentials as described in the next section)

.Additional resources

* For more details on the {productname} Setup Operator, see the upstream
link:https://github.com/redhat-cop/quay-operator/[quay-operator] project.

= Customizing your {productname} cluster
Although you can run a default {productname} setup by simply creating a secret and the `QuayEcosystem`
custom resource, the following sections describe how you can modify
the default setup. Some of those
modifications must be made when you deploy the
QuayEcosystem, while others can be done after
the cluster is running.

== Changing your {productname} credentials
The {productname} Setup Operator sets up default administrative credentials. Review the default superuser and configuration
credentials and change as needed.

=== {productname} superuser credentials
The {productname} superuser credentials
let you manage the users, projects and other components of your
{productname} deployment. Here's how superuser credentials are set by default:

* Username: `quay`
* Password: `password`
* Email: `quay@redhat.com`

To change the superuser credentials, create a new secret:

```
$ oc create secret generic <secret_name> \
   --from-literal=superuser-username=<username> \
   --from-literal=superuser-password=<password> \
   --from-literal=superuser-email=<email>
```
The superuser password must be at least 8 characters.

=== {productname} configuration credentials
A dedicated {productname} deployment runs to manage
{productname} configuration settings. Using the route to that
configuration, you log in with the following credentials:

* Username: `quayconfig`
* Password: `quay`

You cannot change the username, but you can change the password as follows:

```
$ oc create secret generic quay-config-app \
      --from-literal=config-app-password=<password>
```

== Providing persistent storage using PostgreSQL database

The PostgreSQL relational database is used by default as the persistent
store for {productname}. PostgreSQL can either be deployed by the
Operator within the namespace or leverage an existing instance.
The determination of whether to provision an instance or not within the
current namespace depends on whether the server property within the
`QuayEcosystem` is defined.

The following options are a portion of the available options to configure the
PostgreSQL database:

[width="50%"]
|=======
|Property |Description
|image |Location of the database image
|volumeSize |Size of the volume in Kubernetes capacity units
|=======

[NOTE]
====
It is important to note that persistent storage for the database
will only be provisioned if the `volumeSize` property is specified when
provisioned by the operator.
====

Define the values as shown below:
```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
    database:
      volumeSize: 10Gi
```
== Specifying database credentials

The credentials for accessing the server can be specified through a Secret or when being provisioned by the operator, leverage the following default values:

* **Username**: `quay`
* **Password**: `quay`
* **Root Password**: `quayAdmin`
* **Database Name**: `quay`

To define alternate values, create a secret as shown below:

```
oc create secret generic <secret_name> \
    --from-literal=database-username=<username> \
    --from-literal=database-password=<password> \
    --from-literal=database-root-password=<root-password> \
    --from-literal=database-name=<database-name>
```

Reference the name of the secret in the `QuayEcosystem` custom resource as shown below:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
    database:
      credentialsSecretName: <secret_name>
```

=== Using an existing PostgreSQL database instance

Instead of having the operator deploy an instance of PostgreSQL in the
project, an existing instance can be leveraged by specifying the location
in the server field along with the credentials for access as described
in the previous section. The following is an example of how to specify
connecting to a remote PostgreSQL instance:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
    database:
      credentialsSecretName: <secret_name>
      server: postgresql.databases.example.com
```

== Choosing a registry storage backend

Red Hat Quay supports multiple backends for the purpose of image
storage and consist of a variety of local and cloud storage options.
The following sections provide an overview how to configure the
{productname} Setup Operator to make use of these backends.

=== Overview of storage backends

Storage for {productname} can be configured using the `registryBackend`
field within the quay property in the `QuayEcosystem` resource which
contain an array of backends. The ability to define multiple backends
enables replication and high availability of images.

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    registryBackends:
      - name: backend1
        s3:
        ...
```

The definition of a `registryBackend` is an optional field, and if omitted,
`LocalStorage` will be configured (ephemeral, through the use of a
`PersistentVolume`, can be enabled if desired).

=== Sensitive storage values

In many cases, access to storage requires the use of sensitive values.
Each backend that requires such configuration can be included in a Secret
and defined within the `credentialsSecretName` property of the backend.

Instead of declaring the registry backend properties within the specific backend, the values can be added to a secret as shown below:

```
oc create secret generic s3-credentials \
   --from-literal=accessKey=<accessKey> \
   --from-literal=secretKey=<secretKey>
```

With the values now present in the secret, the properties explicitly
declared in the backend can be removed.

Specific details on the types of properties supported for each backend are found in the registry backend details below.

=== Storage replication

Support is available to replicate the registry storage to multiple backends.
To activate storage replication, set the `enableStorageReplication`
property to the value of `true`. Individual registry backends can also be
configured to be replicated by default by setting the
`replicateByDefault` property to the value of true.
A full configuration demonstrating the replication options available
is shown below:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    enableStorageReplication: true
    registryBackends:
      - name: azure-ussouthcentral
        credentialsSecretName: azure-ussouthcentral-registry
        replicateByDefault: true
        azure:
          containerName: quay
      - name: azure-seasia
        credentialsSecretName: azure-seasia-registry
        replicateByDefault: true
        azure:
          containerName: quay
```

[NOTE]
====
Support for replicated storage is not available for the local registry backend and will result in an error during the verification phase.
====

=== Registry storage backend types

One or more of the following registry storage backends can be defined to
specify the underlying storage for the {productname} registry:

==== Local Storage

The following is an example for configuring the registry to make use of `local` storage
(note that local storage is not supported for production deployments):

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    registryBackends:
      - name: local
        local:
          storagePath: /opt/quayregistry
```

The following is a comprehensive list of properties for the `local`
registry backend:

[width="75%"]
|=======
| Property |Description |Credential Secret Supported |Required
| storagePath |Storage Directory |No |No
|=======

==== Configuring persistent local storage

By default, {productname} uses an ephemeral volume for local storage.
In order to avoid data loss, persistent storage is required.
To enable the use of a `PersistentVolume` to store images, specify the
`registryStorage` parameter underneath the quay property.

The following example will cause a `PersistentVolumeClaim` to be created
within the project requesting storage of 10Gi and an access mode of
`ReadWriteOnce`. The default value is `ReadWriteMany`.

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
    registryStorage:
      persistentVolumeAccessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
      persistentVolumeSize: 10Gi
```

A Storage Class can also be provided using the `persistentVolumeStorageClassName` property.

==== Amazon Web Services (S3)

The following is an example for configuring the registry to make
use of S3 storage on Amazon Web Services.

|=======

== Repository Mirroring
{productname} provides the capability to create container image repositories
that exactly match the content of external registries. This functionality can
be enabled by setting the enableRepoMirroring: true as shown below:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
    enableRepoMirroring: true
```

The following additional options are also available:

* repoMirrorTLSVerify - Require HTTPS and verify certificates of Quay registry during mirror
* repoMirrorServerHostname - URL for use by the skopeo copy command
* repoMirrorEnvVars - Environment variables to be applied to the repository mirror container
* repoMirrorResources - Compute resources to be applied to the repository mirror container

== Injecting configuration files

Files related to the configuration of {productname} are located in
the `/conf/stack` directory. There are situations for which
additional user-defined configuration files need to be added to this
directory (such as certificates and private keys). For {productname} deployments not managed by the Operator, these files are managed by
the {productname} config tool.

The {productname} Setup Operator supports the injection of these assets
within the `configFiles` property in the `quay` property of the
`QuayEcosystem` object where one or more assets can be specified.

Two types of configuration files can be specified by the type property:

* **config**: Configuration files that will be added to the `/conf/stack` directory
* **extraCaCerts**: Certificates to be trusted by the quay container

Configuration files are stored as values within Secrets. The first step is to create a secret containing these files. The following command illustrates how a private key can be added:

```
$ oc create secret generic quayconfigfile --from-file=<path_to_file>
```

With the secret created, the secret containing the configuration file can be
referenced in the `QuayEcosystem` object as shown below:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    configFiles:
      - secretName: quayconfigfile
```

By default, the `config` type is assumed. If the contents of the secret
contains certificates that should be added to the `extra_ca_certs`
directory, specify the type as `extraCaCert` as shown below:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    configFiles:
      - secretName: quayconfigfile
        type: extraCaCert
```

Individual keys within a secret can be referenced to fine tune the
resources that are added to the configuration using the `files`
property as shown below:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    configFiles:
      - secretName: quayconfigfile
        files:
          - key: myprivatekey.pem
            filename: cloudfront.pemQuay
          - key: myExtraCaCert.crt
            type: extraCaCert
```

The example above assumes that two files have been added to a secret called `quayconfigfile`. The file `myprivatekey.pem` that was added to the secret will be mounted in the quay pod at the path `/conf/stack/cloudfront.pem` since it is a config file type and specifies a custom filename that should be projected into the pod. The `myExtraCaCert.crt` file will be added to the Quay pod within at the path `/conf/stack/extra_certs/myExtraCert.crt`

[NOTE]
====
The `type` property within `files` property overrides the value in the `configFiles` property.
====

== Skipping automated setup

The operator by default is configured to complete the automated setup process for {productname}.
This can be bypassed by setting the `skipSetup` field to `true` as shown below:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
    skipSetup: true
```

== Specifying the {productname} route
{productname} makes use of an OpenShift route to enable ingress. The hostname
for this route is automatically generated as per the configuration of the
OpenShift cluster. Alternatively, the hostname for this route can be explicitly
specified using the hostname property under the externalAccess field as shown below:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
    externalAccess:
      hostname: example-quayecosystem-quay-quay-enterprise.apps.openshift.example.com
```

== Specifying a {productname} configuration route

During the development process, you may want to test the
provisioning and setup of your {productname} server. By default,
the operator will use the internal service to communicate with
the configuration pod. However, when running external to the cluster,
you will need to specify the ingress location for which the setup process
can use.

Specify the configHostname as shown below:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
    externalAccess:
      configHostname: example-quayecosystem-quay-config-quay-enterprise.apps.openshift.example.com
```

== Providing SSL certificates

{productname}, as a secure registry, makes use of SSL certificates to
secure communication between the various components within the
ecosystem. Transport to the Quay user interface and container registry
is secured via SSL certificates. These certificates are generated at
startup with the OpenShift route being configured with a TLS termination
type of `Passthrough`.

===  User provided certificates

SSL certificates can be provided and used instead of having the operator generate certificates. Certificates can be provided in a secret which is then referenced in the `QuayEcosystem` custom resource.

The secret containing custom certificates must define the following keys:

* **tls.cert**: All of the certificates (root, intermediate, certificate) concatinated into a single file

* **tls.key**: Private key as for the SSL certificate

Create a secret containing the certificate and private key:

```
oc create secret generic custom-quay-ssl \
   --from-file=tls.key=<ssl_private_key> \
   --from-file=tls.cert=<ssl_certificate>
```
The secret containing the certificates are referenced using the
`sslCertificatesSecretName` property as shown below:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
    externalAccess:
      tls:
        secretName: custom-quay-ssl
```

== TLS Termination

{productname} can be configured to protect connections using SSL certificates.
By default, SSL communicated is termminated within {productname}. There are
several different ways that SSL termination can be configured including
omitting the use of certificates altogeter. TLS termination is determined by
the termination property as shown below:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
    externalAccess:
      tls:
        termination: passthrough
```

The example above is the default configuration applied to {productname}.
Alternate options are available as described below:

[width="75%"]
|=======
| TLS Termination Type |Description |Notes
| passthrough |SSL communication is terminated at Quay |Default configuration
| edge 	|SSL commmunication is terminated prior to reaching Quay. Traffic reaching quay is not encrypted (HTTP) |
| none | All communication is unencrypted |
|=======

= Configuration deployment after initial setup

By default, the {productname} Config Tool pod is left running even after the
initial setup process. To configure the Config Tool pod to be
removed after setup, the keepConfigDeployment property within the
{productname} object can can be set as false as shown below:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
    keepConfigDeployment: false
```

== Setting Redis password

By default, the operator managed Redis instance is deployed without a password. A password can be specified by creating a secret containing the password in the key `password`. The following command can be used to create the secret:

```
$ oc create secret generic <secret_name> \
   --from-literal=password=<password>
```

The secret can then be specified within the `redis` section using the `credentialsSecretName` as shown below:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  redis:
    credentialsSecretName: <secret_name>
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
```

== Enabling Clair image scanning

link:https://github.com/quay/clair[Clair] is a vulnerability assessment
tool for application containers. Support is available to automatically
provision and configure both Clair and its integration with {productname}.
A property called `clair` can be specified in the `QuayEcosystem` object
along with `enabled: true` within this field in order to deploy Clair.
An example is shown below:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
  clair:
    enabled: true
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
```

The Quay Operator sets the Clair database connection string with the parameter
`sslmode=disable` if no parameters are specified in QuayEcosystem custom
resource. In case you have SSL enabled Postgres database, or want to add
other parameters, provide `key: value` pairs as strings (for example,
 connect_timeout: '10') under connectionParameters object.

For example: 

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
  clair:
    enabled: true
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
    database:
      connectionParameters:
        sslmode: require
        connect_timeout: '10'
```

Supported connection string parameters:

* **sslmode** - Whether or not to use SSL (default is require, this is not the default for libpq)
* **connect_timeout** - Maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Zero or not specified means wait indefinitely.
* **sslcert** - Cert file location. The file must contain PEM encoded data.
* **sslkey** - Key file location. The file must contain PEM encoded data.
* **sslrootcert** - The location of the root certificate file. The file must contain PEM encoded data.

Valid values for sslmode are:

* **disable** - No SSL
* **require** - Always SSL (skip verification)
* **verify-ca** - Always SSL (verify that the certificate presented by the server
was signed by a trusted CA)
* **verify-full** - Always SSL (verify that the certification presented by the
server was signed by a trusted CA and the server host name matches the one in the certificate)

=== Clair update interval

Clair routinely queries CVE databases in order to build its own internal
database. By default, this value is set at 500m. You can modify the time
interval between checks by setting the `updateInterval` property as shown below:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
  clair:
    enabled: true
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
    updateInterval: "60m"
```

The above configuration would have Clair update every 60 minutes.

== Setting common attributes

Each of the following components expose a set of similar properties that
can be specified in order to customize the runtime execution:

* {productname}
* {productname} Configuration
* {productname} PostgreSQL
* Redis
* Clair
* Clair PostgreSQL

=== Image pull secret

As referenced in prior sections, an Image Pull Secret can specify the
name of the secret containing credentials to an image from a protected
registry using the property `imagePullSecret`.

=== Image

There may be a desire to make use of an alternate image or source location for
each of the components in the Quay ecosystem. The most common use case is to
make use of an image registry that contains all of the needed images instead of
being sourced from the public internet. Each component has a property called image
where the location of the related image can be referenced from.

The following is an example of how a customized image location can be specified:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    image: myregistry.example.com/quay/quay:v3.1.0
```

=== Compute resources

link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/#resource-requests-and-limits-of-pod-and-container[Compute Resources]
such as memory and CPU can be specified in the same form as any other value in a `PodTemplate`.
CPU and Memory values for `requests` and `limits` can be specified under a property called `resources`.

[NOTE]
====
In the case of the `QuayConfiguration` deployment, `configResources`
is the property which should be referenced underneath the `quay` property.
====

The following is an example of how compute resources can be specified:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: 512Mi
```

=== Probes

link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-probes/[Readiness and Liveness Probes] can be specified in the same form as any other value in a `PodTemplate`.

The following is how a `readinessProbe` and `livenessProbe`
can be specified:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
    livenessProbe:
      initialDelaySeconds: 120
      httpGet:
        path: /health/instance
        port: 8443
        scheme: HTTPS
    readinessProbe:
      initialDelaySeconds: 10
      httpGet:
        path: /health/instance
        port: 8443
        scheme: HTTPS
```

[NOTE]
====
If a value for either property is not specified, an opinionated default value is applied.
====

=== Node Selector

Components of the `QuayEcosystem` may need to be
deployed to only a subset of available nodes in a Kubernetes cluster.
This functionality can be set on each of the resources using the
`nodeSelector` property as shown below:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
    nodeSelector:
      node-role.kubernetes.io/infra: true
```

=== Deployment strategy

Each of the core components consist of Kubernetes `Deployments`.
This resource supports the method in which new versions are released.
This operator supports making use of the `RollingUpdate` and `Recreate`
strategies. Either value can be defined by using the `deploymentStrategy`
property on the desired resource as shown below:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
    deploymentStrategy: RollingUpdate
```

[NOTE]
====
The absence of a defined value will make use of the `RollingUpdate`
strategy.
====

=== Environment Variables

In addition to environment variables that are automatically configured
by the operator, users can define their own set of environment variables
in order to customize the managed resources. Each core component includes
a property called envVars where environment variables can be defined. An
example is shown below:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
    envVars:
      - name: FOO
        value: bar
```

[NOTE]
====
Environment variables for the Quay configuration pod can be managed by specifying the `configEnvVars` property on the `quay` resource.
====

[WARNING]
====
User defined environment variables are given precedence over those managed by the operator. Undesirable results may occur if conflicting keys are used.
====

= Configuring {productname} (post-deployment)

After the Quay Operator deploys {productname}, by default the Config Tool
continues to run. Going forward, you can use the Config Tool or the
Quay Operator itself to update and maintain your {productname} deployment.

== Using the Config Tool
The {productname} Config Tool provides a web UI for enabling or
modifying many of the settings in your {productname} cluster. 
To use the Config Tool:

. Get the route to the Config Tool by typing:
+
```
$ oc get route 
NAME  HOST/PORT                                      PATH SERVICES PORT TERMINATION WILDCARD
...   example-quayecosystem-quay-config.example.com  ...
```
. Add `https://` to the HOST/PORT entry for the Config Tool and enter it into your
web browser.

. When prompted, log in using the Config Tool user name and password
(`quayconfig` and `quay`, by default).

. Select `Modify configuration for this cluster`.

At this point you can change the configuration as you choose.
When you are done, select Save Configuration Changes. Here are a few
things you should know about using the Config Tool:

* Most changes you make will be checked for accuracy. For example,
if you change the location of a service, the Config Tool will check
that it can reach that service before saving the configuration.
If the connection fails, you have the chance to modify the setting
before saving.

* After you make changes and they are accepted, those changes
are deployed to all {productname} instances in the cluster.
There is no need to stop and restart those pods manually.

== Using the Quay Operator
Updating your {productname} cluster using the Quay Operator offers
a way to deploy changes without having to click through a web UI.
Here are some things you should know about changing settings
through the Operator:

* The same level of error checking is not performed when you
change settings directly through the Quay Operator. If, for example,
you provide the wrong address to a service, the connection to that
service will probably just fail and you would have to track down
the problem through OpenShift.

* Once you make a change, those changes will not automatically be
applied to your {productname} instances. To have the changes take
effect, you will have to restart the {productname} pods manually.


= Troubleshooting

To resolve issues running, configuring and utilizing the operator,
the following steps may be utilized:

== Errors during initial setup

The `QuayEcosystem` custom resource will attempt to provide the progress
of the status of the deployment and configuration of {productname}.
Additional information related to any errors in the setup process can
be found by viewing the log messages of the `config` pod as shown below:

```
$ oc logs $(oc get pods -l=quay-enterprise-component=config -o name)
```

From the OpenShift console, you can follow the Pods and Deployments that
are created for your {productname} cluster.

= Local Development

Execute the following steps to develop the functionality locally.
It is recommended that development be done using a cluster with
cluster-admin permissions.

Clone the repository, then resolve all dependencies using `go mod`:

```
$ export GO111MODULE=on
$ go mod vendor
```

Using the link:https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk[operator-sdk],
run the operator locally:

```
$ operator-sdk up local --namespace=quay-enterprise
```

= Upgrading {productname} 
The Quay Operator v3.3.0 has many changes from v1.0.2. The most notable which
affects the upgrade process is the backwards-incompatible change to the CRD.
Ultimately, the CR (Custom Resource) used to deploy {productname} using the operator
may have to be modified accordingly.

== Upgrade Prerequisites
Ensure that your deployment is using a supported persistance layer and
database. A production {productname} deployment run by the Operator should *not* be
relying on the Postgres instance or a OpenShift volume that has
been created by the Operator.

If you are using a Postgres instance or OpenShift volume that was created
by the Operator, the upgrade path is not suported as the removal of the old
Operator will cascade the deletion of your database and volume. It may be
possible to manually migrate your data to supported storage mechanisms but
this is not within the scope of the typical, or supported, upgrade path.

Please read through the entire guide before following any steps as this upgrade
path is potentially destructive and there is no guaranteed roll-back mechanism.

== Upgrade Process Summary

Here are the basic steps for upgrading the {productname} cluster
you originally deployed from the v1.0.2 Quay Setup Operator to
the v3.3 Quay Operator:

. Document all configuration related to your current deployment.
. Copy your CR and modify any configuration values as needed.
. Remove your current deployment using `oc delete -f deployment.yaml`
. Ensure that only one quay pod will be started, as this Pod will perform any
database migrations needed before scaling up the entire cluster.
. Uninstall the old Quay Operator (v1.0.2 or older)
. Install the latest Quay Operator (v3.3.0)
. Create your CR by issuing the command `oc create -f new_deployment.yaml`
. Watch the logs of your Quay Pod until all migrations have finished.
. At this point, it is safe to scale up your Quay cluster if desired.

=== Document the existing {productname} deployment

For the purpose of ensuring a smooth upgrade, it is important to ensure you
have all available configuration details *before* deleting your existing
deployment. In the case that you must work with Red Hat Support, this
information will aid them with the details needed to bring your cluster back
to its original state. At minimum, the following information should be
gathered:

. The Custom Resource used to create your current Quay deployment.
. The output of running `oc get QuayEcosystem -o yaml > quayecosystem.yaml`
in your Project or Namespace.
. The hostnames currently used to access Quay, Clair, Quay's Config App,
Postgres, Redis, and Clair's Postgres instance. This can be achieved by
executing: `oc get routes -o yaml > old_routes.yaml`
. Any authentication details required to connect to your Postgres instance(s)
for Quay and Clair.
. Any authentication details required to connect to your data persistance
provider such as AWS S3.
. Backup your Quay's configuration secret which contains the `config.yaml`
along with any certificates needed. This can be accomplished by using the
following command:
+
```
$ oc get secret quay-enterprise-config-secret -o yaml > config-secret.yaml
```

=== Update the CR

Ensure a backup is created of your original Custom Resource (CR) before making any
changes.

If your deployment does not specify any specific network-related configuration
values, this step may not be necessary. Please refer to the documentation to
ensure that your the configuration options in your current CR are still
accurate for the Quay Operator v3.3.0.

In the case that you have specified options related to the management of
networking, such as using a LoadBalancer or specifying a custom hostname,
please reference the latest documentation to update them with the schema
changes included in Quay Operator v3.3.0.

If you have overridden the image used for Quay or Clair, please keep in mind
that Quay Operator v3.3.0 specifically supports Quay v3.3.0 and Clair v????.
It is advisable to remove those image overrides to use the latest, supported
releases of Quay and Clair in your deployment. Any other images may not be
supported.

=== Remove the existing deployment

[WARNING]
====
This step will remove your entire {productname} deployment. Use caution and
ensure you understand all steps required to recreate your cluster
before removing your existing deployment.
====

The Quay Operator v3.3.0 is now distributed using the official Red Hat channels.
Previously, Quay Operator v1.0.2 (and below) were provided using "Community"
channels. Additionally, 3.3.0 offers no automatic upgrade path which requires
your Quay deployment and the Quay Operator to be completely removed and
replaced.

Fortunately, the important data is stored in your Postgres datbase and your
storage backend so it is advisable to ensure you have proper backups for both.

Once you are ready, remove your existing deployment by issuing the following
command:

```
$ oc delete -f deployment.yaml
```

All Quay and Clair pods will be removed as well as the Redis pod. At this
point, your Quay cluster will be completely down and inaccesible. It is
suggested to inform your users of a maintenance window as they will not be
able to access their images during this time.

=== Ensure only the quay pod is started

When Quay pods start, they will look at the database to determine whether all
required database schema changes are applied. If the schema changes are not
applied, which is more than likely going to be the case when upgrading from
Quay v3.2 to v3.3.0, then the Quay pod will automatically begin running all
migrations. If multiple Quay instances are running simultaenously, they may
all attempt to update or modify the database at the same time which may
result in unexpected issues.

To ensure that the migrations are run correctly, do not specify more than a
single Quay replica to be started. Note that the default quantity of Quay pod
replicas is 1, so unless you changed it, there is no work to be done here.

=== Uninstall the Quay Operator

Verify that all Quay-related deployments and pods no longer exist within your
namespace. Ensure that no other Quay deployments depend upon the installed
Quay Operator v1.0.2 (or earlier).

Using OpenShift, navigate to the `Operators > Installed Operators` page.
The UI will present you with the option to delete the operator.


=== Install the new Quay Operator 

Previously, the Quay Operator (v1.0.2 and prior) were provided using the
"community" Operator Hub catalog. In the latest release, the Quay Operator is
released through official Red Hat channels.

In the OpenShift UI, navigate to `Operators > OperatorHub` and then simply
search for `Quay`. Ensure you are choosing the correct Quay Operator v3.3.0
in the even that you encounter multiple, similar results. Simply click
`install` and choose the correct namespace/project to install the operator.

=== Recreate the deployment

At this point, the following assumptions are made based upon the previous steps
documented in this upgrade process:

. Your CR is updated to reflect any differences in the latest operator's
schema (CRD).
. Quay Operator v3.3.0 is installed into your project/namespace
. Any secrets necessary to deploy Quay exist
. Your CR defines either 1 Quay Pod replica or does not specify any quanity
of Quay replicas which defaults to 1.

Once you are ready, simply create your QuayEcosystem by executing the command:

```
$ oc create -f new_deployment.yaml
```

At this point, the Quay Operator will begin to deploy Redis, the Quay
Config Application, and finally your (single) Quay Pod.


=== Monitor the database schema update progress

Assuming that you are upgrading from Quay v3.2 to Quay v3.3, it will be
necessary for Quay to perform schema updates to your database. These can be
viewed in your Quay pod's logs.

Do not proceed with any additional steps until you are sure that the database
migrations are complete. 

[NOTE]
====
These migrations should occur early in the pod's logs so it may be easy to overlook them.
====

=== Finalize the {productname} cluster upgrade

Now that the latest release of {productname}, and optionally Clair, have been
deployed to your Openshift cluster, it is time to verify your configuration and
scale as needed.

You can compare the results of the current configuration with the previous
configuration referencing, the documentation gathered in the first step of this
process. It is recommended to pay close attention to your hostname(s) and
glance at all logs to look for any issues that may not have been obvious or
caught by the Quay Operator.

It is also recommended to perform a quick "smoke test" on your environment to
ensure that the major functionality is working as expected. One example test
may include performing pushes and pulls from the registry on existing, and new,
images. Another example may be accessing Quay's UI as a registered user and
ensuring that the expected TLS certificate is used. If you rely on the Quay
Operator to generate a self-signed TLS certificate then keep in mind that a new
certificate may have been created by this process.

If multiple replicas are needed to scale your Quay registry, it is now safe
to change the replica count to your desired quantity.

Finally, it would be highly recommended to ensure your store your configuration
and any relevant OpenShift secrets in a safe, preferably encrypted, backup.
