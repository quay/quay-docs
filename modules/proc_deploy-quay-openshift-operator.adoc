= Deploying {productname}
[id="deploy-quay-openshift-operator"]

// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

This procedure:

* Installs the {productname} Setup Operator on OpenShift from the OperatorHub
* Deploys a {productname} cluster on OpenShift with the Setup Operator

You have the option of changing dozens of settings before deploying the
{productname} Setup Operator.
The Operator automates the entire start-up process,
by-passing the {productname} config tool. You can choose to
skip the Operator's automated configuration and use the config tool directly.

.Prerequisites

* An OpenShift 3.x or 4.x cluster
* Cluster-scope admin privilege to the OpenShift cluster

.Procedure

You have two choices for deploying the {productname} Operator:

* **Advanced Setup**: Go through the `Customizing your
{productname} cluster`
section and change any setting you desire
before running this procedure.

* **Standard Setup**: Just step through the procedure as is to use
all the default setting.

== Install the {productname} Setup Operator

. From the OpenShift console, select Operators -> OperatorHub, then select
the {productname} Operator.

. Select Install. The Operator Subscription page appears.

. Choose the following then select Subscribe:

* Installation Mode: Select a specific namespace to install to

* Update Channel: Choose the update channel (only one may be available)

* Approval Strategy: Choose to approve automatic or manual updates

== Deploy a {productname} ecosystem

. See the
link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3533201[Accessing Red Hat Quay]
article for information on getting credentials needed to obtain the
quay container from Quay.io. Then put those credentials in a file. In this example, we create a
config.json in the local directory.

. Create a secret that includes your credentials, as follows:
+
```
$ oc create secret generic redhat-pull-secret \
    --from-file=".dockerconfigjson=config.json" --type='kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson'
```

. Create a custom resource file (in this example, named `quayecosystem_cr.yaml`) or copy one from the link:https://github.com/redhat-cop/quay-operator/tree/master/deploy/examples[quay-operator examples] page. This example uses default settings:
+
```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
```

. Go through the `Customizing
your {productname} cluster` section to choose configuration settings you want to change.

. Deploy the Quay ecosystem from your custom
resource file as follows:
+
```
$ oc create -f quayecosystem_cr.yaml
```
+
Deploying the custom resource automatically creates and configures
the {productname} cluster, which includes the {productname}, PostgreSQL,
and Redis services.

. To check the status of your {productname} cluster, log in to your
OpenShift web console, select Projects, then select the `quay-enterprise`
project to see the following:
+
image:quay-setup-operator-openshift.png[The {productname} Setup Operator deployed in OpenShift]

If {productname} is running, here is how to get started using
your {productname} configuration:

* Get the route to your new  {productname} cluster as follows:
+
```
$ oc get route
NAME                       HOST/PORT
       PATH                     SERVICES PORT TERMINATION           WILDCARD
example-quayecosystem-quay example-quayecosystem-quay-default.example.com
       example-quayecosystem-quay        8443 passthrough/Redirect  None

```

* Using that route, log in with the superuser credentials (Username: `quay` and Password: `password` or change credentials as described in the next section)

.Additional resources

* For more details on the {productname} Setup Operator, see the upstream
link:https://github.com/redhat-cop/quay-operator/[quay-operator] project.

= Customizing your {productname} cluster
Although you can run a default {productname} setup by simply creating a secret and the `QuayEcosystem`
custom resource, the following sections describe how you can modify
the default setup. Some of those
modifications must be made when you deploy the
QuayEcosystem, while others can be done after
the cluster is running.

== Changing your {productname} credentials
The {productname} Setup Operator sets up default administrative credentials. Review the default superuser and configuration
credentials and change as needed.

=== {productname} superuser credentials
The {productname} superuser credentials
let you manage the users, projects and other components of your
{productname} deployment. Here's how superuser credentials are set by default:

* Username: `quay`
* Password: `password`
* Email: `quay@redhat.com`

To change the superuser credentials, create a new secret:

```
$ oc create secret generic <secret_name> \
   --from-literal=superuser-username=<username> \
   --from-literal=superuser-password=<password> \
   --from-literal=superuser-email=<email>
```
The superuser password must be at least 8 characters.

=== {productname} configuration credentials
A dedicated {productname} deployment runs to manage
{productname} configuration settings. Using the route to that
configuration, you log in with the following credentials:

* Username: `quayconfig`
* Password: `quay`

You cannot change the username, but you can change the password as follows:

```
$ oc create secret generic quay-config-app \
      --from-literal=config-app-password=<password>
```

== Providing persistent storage using PostgreSQL database

The PostgreSQL relational database is used by default as the persistent
store for {productname}. PostgreSQL can either be deployed by the
Operator within the namespace or leverage an existing instance.
The determination of whether to provision an instance or not within the
current namespace depends on whether the server property within the
`QuayEcosystem` is defined.

The following options are a portion of the available options to configure the
PostgreSQL database:

[width="50%"]
|=======
|Property |Description
|image |Location of the database image
|volumeSize |Size of the volume in Kubernetes capacity units
|=======

[NOTE]
====
It is important to note that persistent storage for the database
will only be provisioned if the `volumeSize` property is specified when
provisioned by the operator.
====

Define the values as shown below:
```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
    database:
      volumeSize: 10Gi
```
== Specifying database credentials

The credentials for accessing the server can be specified through a Secret or when being provisioned by the operator, leverage the following default values:

* **Username**: `quay`
* **Password**: `quay`
* **Root Password**: `quayAdmin`
* **Database Name**: `quay`

To define alternate values, create a secret as shown below:

```
oc create secret generic <secret_name> \
    --from-literal=database-username=<username> \
    --from-literal=database-password=<password> \
    --from-literal=database-root-password=<root-password> \
    --from-literal=database-name=<database-name>
```

Reference the name of the secret in the `QuayEcosystem` custom resource as shown below:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
    database:
      credentialsSecretName: <secret_name>
```

=== Using an existing PostgreSQL database instance

Instead of having the operator deploy an instance of PostgreSQL in the
project, an existing instance can be leveraged by specifying the location
in the server field along with the credentials for access as described
in the previous section. The following is an example of how to specify
connecting to a remote PostgreSQL instance:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
    database:
      credentialsSecretName: <secret_name>
      server: postgresql.databases.example.com
```

== Choosing a registry storage backend

Red Hat Quay supports multiple backends for the purpose of image
storage and consist of a variety of local and cloud storage options.
The following sections provide an overview how to configure the
{productname} Setup Operator to make use of these backends.

=== Overview of storage backends

Storage for {productname} can be configured using the `registryBackend`
field within the quay property in the `QuayEcosystem` resource which
contain an array of backends. The ability to define multiple backends
enables replication and high availability of images.

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadaLocalStorageta:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    registryBackends:
      - name: backend1
        s3:
        ...
```

The definition of a `registryBackend` is an optional field, and if omitted,
`LocalStorage` will be configured (ephemeral, through the use of a
`PersistentVolume`, can be enabled if desired).

=== Sensitive storage values

In many cases, access to storage requires the use of sensitive values.
Each backend that requires such configuration can be included in a Secret
and defined within the `credentialsSecretName` property of the backend.

Instead of declaring the registry backend properties within the specific backend, the values can be added to a secret as shown below:

```
oc create secret generic s3-credentials \
   --from-literal=accessKey=<accessKey> \
   --from-literal=secretKey=<secretKey>
```

With the values now present in the secret, the properties explicitly
declared in the backend can be removed.

Specific details on the types of properties supported for each backend are found in the registry backend details below.

=== Storage replication

Support is available to replicate the registry storage to multiple backends.
To activate storage replication, set the `enableStorageReplication`
property to the value of `true`. Individual registry backends can also be
configured to be replicated by default by setting the
`replicateByDefault` property to the value of true.
A full configuration demonstrating the replication options available
is shown below:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    enableStorageReplication: true
    registryBackends:
      - name: azure-ussouthcentral
        credentialsSecretName: azure-ussouthcentral-registry
        replicateByDefault: true
        azure:
          containerName: quay
      - name: azure-seasia
        credentialsSecretName: azure-seasia-registry
        replicateByDefault: true
        azure:
          containerName: quay
```

[NOTE]
====
Support for replicated storage is not available for the local registry backend and will result in an error during the verification phase.
====

=== Registry storage backend types

One or more of the following registry storage backends can be defined to
specify the underlying storage for the {productname} registry:

==== Local Storage

The following is an example for configuring the registry to make use of `local` storage:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    registryBackends:
      - name: local
        local:
          storagePath: /opt/quayregistry
```

The following is a comprehensive list of properties for the `local`
registry backend:

[width="75%"]
|=======
| Property |Description |Credential Secret Supported |Required
| storagePath |Storage Directory |No |No
|=======

==== Configuring persistent local storage

By default, {productname} uses an ephemeral volume for local storage.
In order to avoid data loss, persistent storage is required.
To enable the use of a `PersistentVolume` to store images, specify the
`registryStorage` parameter underneath the quay property.

The following example will cause a `PersistentVolumeClaim` to be created
within the project requesting storage of 10Gi and an access mode of
`ReadWriteOnce`. The default value is `ReadWriteMany`.

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
    registryStorage:
      persistentVolumeAccessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
      persistentVolumeSize: 10Gi
```

A Storage Class can also be provided using the `persistentVolumeStorageClassName` property.

==== Amazon Web Services (S3)

The following is an example for configuring the registry to make
use of S3 storage on Amazon Web Services.

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1

== Injecting configuration files

Files related to the configuration of {productname} are located in
the `/conf/stack` directory. There are situations for which
additional user-defined configuration files need to be added to this
directory (such as certificates and private keys). For {productname} deployments not managed by the Operator, these files are managed by
the {productname} config tool.

The {productname} Setup Operator supports the injection of these assets
within the `configFiles` property in the `quay` property of the
`QuayEcosystem` object where one or more assets can be specified.

Two types of configuration files can be specified by the type property:

* **config**: Configuration files that will be added to the `/conf/stack` directory
* **extraCaCerts**: Certificates to be trusted by the quay container

Configuration files are stored as values within Secrets. The first step is to create a secret containing these files. The following command illustrates how a private key can be added:

```
$ oc create secret generic quayconfigfile --from-file=<path_to_file>
```

With the secret created, the secret containing the configuration file can be
referenced in the `QuayEcosystem` object as shown below:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    configFiles:
      - secretName: quayconfigfile
```

By default, the `config` type is assumed. If the contents of the secret
contains certificates that should be added to the `extra_ca_certs`
directory, specify the type as `extraCaCert` as shown below:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    configFiles:
      - secretName: quayconfigfile
        type: extraCaCert
```

Individual keys within a secret can be referenced to fine tune the
resources that are added to the configuration using the `files`
property as shown below:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    configFiles:
      - secretName: quayconfigfile
        files:
          - key: myprivatekey.pem
            filename: cloudfront.pemQuay
          - key: myExtraCaCert.crt
            type: extraCaCert
```

The example above assumes that two files have been added to a secret called `quayconfigfile`. The file `myprivatekey.pem` that was added to the secret will be mounted in the quay pod at the path `/conf/stack/cloudfront.pem` since it is a config file type and specifies a custom filename that should be projected into the pod. The `myExtraCaCert.crt` file will be added to the Quay pod within at the path `/conf/stack/extra_certs/myExtraCert.crt`

[NOTE]
====
The `type` property within `files` property overrides the value in the `configFiles` property.
====

== Skipping automated setup

The operator by default is configured to complete the automated setup process for {productname}.
This can be bypassed by setting the `skipSetup` field to `true` as shown below:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
    skipSetup: true
```

== Providing SSL certificates

{productname}, as a secure registry, makes use of SSL certificates to
secure communication between the various components within the
ecosystem. Transport to the Quay user interface and container registry
is secured via SSL certificates. These certificates are generated at
startup with the OpenShift route being configured with a TLS termination
type of `Passthrough`.

===  User provided certificates

SSL certificates can be provided and used instead of having the operator generate certificates. Certificates can be provided in a secret which is then referenced in the `QuayEcosystem` custom resource.

The secret containing custom certificates must define the following keys:

* **ssl.cert**: All of the certificates (root, intermediate, certificate) concatinated into a single file

* **ssl.key**: Private key as for the SSL certificate

Create a secret containing the certificate and private key:

```
oc create secret generic custom-quay-ssl \
   --from-file=ssl.key=<ssl_private_key> \
   --from-file=ssl.cert=<ssl_certificate>
```
The secret containing the certificates are referenced using the
`sslCertificatesSecretName` property as shown below:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
    sslCertificatesSecretName: custom-quay-ssl
```

== Specifying the {productname} route

{productname} makes use of an OpenShift route to enable ingress. The hostname for
this route is automatically generated as per the configuration of the
OpenShift cluster. Alternatively, the hostname for this route can be
explicitly specified using the `hostname` property under the `quay` field
as shown below:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    hostname: example-quayecosystem-quay-quay-enterprise.apps.openshift.example.com
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
```

== Specifying a {productname} configuration route

During the development process, you may want to test the provisioning and setup of {productname}. By default, the Operator will use the internal service to communicate with the configuration pod. However, when running external to the cluster, you will need to specify the ingress location for which the setup process can use.

Specify the `configHostname` as shown below:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    configHostname: example-quayecosystem-quay-config-quay-enterprise.apps.openshift.example.com
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
```

= Configuration deployment after initial setup

In order to conserve resources, the configuration deployment of
{productname} is removed after the initial setup. In certain cases,
there may be a need to further configure the {productname}
environment. To specify that the configuration deployment should
be retained, the `keepConfigDeployment` property within the `quay` object can be set as `true` as shown below:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
    keepConfigDeployment: true
```

== Setting Redis password

By default, the operator managed Redis instance is deployed without a password. A password can be specified by creating a secret containing the password in the key `password`. The following command can be used to create the secret:

```
$ oc create secret generic <secret_name> \
   --from-literal=password=<password>
```

The secret can then be specified within the `redis` section using the `credentialsSecretName` as shown below:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  redis:
    credentialsSecretName: <secret_name>
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
```

== Enabling Clair image scanning

link:https://github.com/quay/clair[Clair] is a vulnerability assessment
tool for application containers. Support is available to automatically
provision and configure both Clair and its integration with {productname}.
A property called `clair` can be specified in the `QuayEcosystem` object
along with `enabled: true` within this field in order to deploy Clair.
An example is shown below:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
  clair:
    enabled: true
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
```

=== Clair update interval

Clair routinely queries CVE databases in order to build its own internal
database. By default, this value is set at 500m. You can modify the time
interval between checks by setting the `updateInterval` property as shown below:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
  clair:
    enabled: true
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
    updateInterval: "60m"
```

The above configuration would have Clair update every 60 minutes.

== Setting common attributes

Each of the following components expose a set of similar properties that
can be specified in order to customize the runtime execution:

* {productname}
* {productname} Configuration
* {productname} PostgreSQL
* Redis
* Clair
* Clair PostgreSQL

=== Image pull secret

As referenced in prior sections, an Image Pull Secret can specify the
name of the secret containing credentials to an image from a protected
registry using the property `imagePullSecret`.

=== Image

There may be a desire to make use of an alternate image or source location for
each of the components in the Quay ecosystem. The most common use case is to
make use of an image registry that contains all of the needed images instead of
being sourced from the public internet. Each component has a property called image
where the location of the related image can be referenced from.

The following is an example of how a customized image location can be specified:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    image: myregistry.example.com/quay/quay:v3.1.0
```

=== Compute resources

link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/#resource-requests-and-limits-of-pod-and-container[Compute Resources]
such as memory and CPU can be specified in the same form as any other value in a `PodTemplate`.
CPU and Memory values for `requests` and `limits` can be specified under a property called `resources`.

[NOTE]
====
In the case of the `QuayConfiguration` deployment, `configResources`
is the property which should be referenced underneath the `quay` property.
====

The following is an example of how compute resources can be specified:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: 512Mi
```

=== Probes

link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-probes/[Readiness and Liveness Probes] can be specified in the same form as any other value in a `PodTemplate`.

The following is how a `readinessProbe` and `livenessProbe`
can be specified:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
    livenessProbe:
      initialDelaySeconds: 120
      httpGet:
        path: /health/instance
        port: 8443
        scheme: HTTPS
    readinessProbe:
      initialDelaySeconds: 10
      httpGet:
        path: /health/instance
        port: 8443
        scheme: HTTPS
```

[NOTE]
====
If a value for either property is not specified, an opinionated default value is applied.
====

=== Node Selector

Components of the `QuayEcosystem` may need to be
deployed to only a subset of available nodes in a Kubernetes cluster.
This functionality can be set on each of the resources using the
`nodeSelector` property as shown below:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
    nodeSelector:
      node-role.kubernetes.io/infra: true
```

=== Deployment strategy

Each of the core components consist of Kubernetes `Deployments`.
This resource supports the method in which new versions are released.
This operator supports making use of the `RollingUpdate` and `Recreate`
strategies. Either value can be defined by using the `deploymentStrategy`
property on the desired resource as shown below:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
    deploymentStrategy: RollingUpdate
```

[NOTE]
====
The absence of a defined value will make use of the `RollingUpdate`
strategy.
====

=== Environment Variables

In addition to environment variables that are automatically configured
by the operator, users can define their own set of environment variables
in order to customize the managed resources. Each core component includes
a property called envVars where environment variables can be defined. An
example is shown below:

```
apiVersion: redhatcop.redhat.io/v1alpha1
kind: QuayEcosystem
metadata:
  name: example-quayecosystem
spec:
  quay:
    imagePullSecretName: redhat-pull-secret
    envVars:
      - name: FOO
        value: bar
```

[NOTE]
====
Environment variables for the Quay configuration pod can be managed by specifying the `configEnvVars` property on the `quay` resource.
====

[WARNING]
====
User defined environment variables are given precedence over those managed by the operator. Undesirable results may occur if conflicting keys are used.
====

= Troubleshooting

To resolve issues running, configuring and utilizing the operator,
the following steps may be utilized:

== Errors during initial setup

The `QuayEcosystem` custom resource will attempt to provide the progress
of the status of the deployment and configuration of {productname}.
Additional information related to any errors in the setup process can
be found by viewing the log messages of the `config` pod as shown below:

```
$ oc logs $(oc get pods -l=quay-enterprise-component=config -o name)
```

From the OpenShift console, you can follow the Pods and Deployments that
are created for your {productname} cluster.

= Local Development

Execute the following steps to develop the functionality locally.
It is recommended that development be done using a cluster with
cluster-admin permissions.

Clone the repository, then resolve all dependencies using `go mod`:

```
$ export GO111MODULE=on
$ go mod vendor
```

Using the link:https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk[operator-sdk],
run the operator locally:

```
$ operator-sdk up local --namespace=quay-enterprise
```

= Upgrading {productname} and Clair

Before upgrading to a new version of {productname} or Clair, refer to the
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html-single/upgrade_red_hat_quay/index[Upgrade {productname}] guide for details.
The instructions here tell you how to change the quay and clair-jwt containers,
but do not provide the full upgrade instructions.

At the point in the upgrade instructions where you are ready to identify the new quay and clair-jwt containers, here is what you do:

```
$ oc edit quayecosystem/quayecosystem
```

Find and update the following entries:

```
image: quay.io/redhat/clair-jwt:vX.X.X
image: quay.io/redhat/quay:vX.X.X

```

Once saved, the operator will automatically apply the upgrade.


[NOTE]
====
If you used a different name than `QuayEcosystem` for the custom resource
to deploy your Quay ecosystem, you will have to replace the name to fit the proper value.
