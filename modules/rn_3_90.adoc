Issued 2022-05-XXX

{productname} release 3.9.0 is now available with Clair XXX. The bug fixes that are included in the update are listed in the link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2023:XXXX[RHBA-2023:XXXX] advisory.

[id="new-features-and-enhancements-39"]
== {productname}, Clair, and Quay Builder new features and enhancements

The following updates have been made to {productname}, Clair, and Quay Builders:

=== Quota management enhancements

* Prior to {productname} 3.9, the quota management feature created totals by combining the manifest sizes at the repository and namespace level. This created an issue wherein a single blob could be counted multiple times within the total.
+
With this release, individual blob sizes are summed at the repository and namespace level. This provides a more accurate depiction of storage growth and registry consumption. As a result, users can place quota limits on the namespace and repository sizes based on the actual usage of storage by {productname}.
+
For more information, see link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-3942[PROJQUAY-3942].

=== Configuring action log storage for Splunk

* With this release, {productname} administrators can forward logs to a Splunk deployment. This allows administrators to perform log analyses and offload the internal database.
+
