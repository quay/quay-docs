= Setting up a custom Git trigger

After you have created a _custom Git trigger_, two additional steps are required:

. You must provide read access to the SSH public key that is generated when creating the trigger. 

ifeval::["{context}" == "quay-io"]
. You must setup a webhook that POSTs to the {quayio} endpoint to trigger the build. 
endif::[]
ifeval::["{context}" == "quay-builders-image-automation"]
. You must setup a webhook that POSTs to the {productname} endpoint to trigger the build. 
endif::[]

[id="obtaining-build-trigger-credentials"]
== Obtaining build trigger credentials

The SSH public key and Webhook Endpoint URL are available on the {productname} UI. 

.Prerequisites

* You have created a _custom Git trigger_. 

.Procedure

. On the *Builds* page of your repository, click the menu kebab for your _custom Git trigger_. 

. Click *View Credentials*. 

. Save the SSH Public Key and Webhook Endpoint URL. 

The key and the URL are available by selecting *View Credentials* from the *Settings*, or _gear_ icon.

[id="ssh-public-key-access"]
=== SSH public key access

Depending on the Git server configuration, there are multiple ways to install the SSH public key that 
ifeval::["{context}" == "quay-io"]
{quayio}
endif::[]
ifeval::["{context}" == "use-quay"]
{productname}
endif::[]
generates for a custom Git trigger.

For example, documentation for link:https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Getting-Git-on-a-Server[Getting Git on a Server] describes a describes how to set up a Git server on a Linux-based machine with a focus on managing repositories and access control through SSH. In this procedure, a small server is set up to add the keys to the `$HOME/.ssh/authorize_keys` folder, which provides access for _builders_ to clone the repository. 

For any Git repository management software that is not officially supported, there is usually a location to input the key that is often labeled as *Deploy Keys*. 

[id="webhook"]
=== Webhook
To automatically trigger a build, you must `POST` a `.json` payload to the webhook URL using the following format: 

[NOTE]
====
This request requires a `Content-Type` header containing
`application/json` in order to be valid.

This can typically be accomplished with a link:https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#post-receive[`post-receive` Git hook], however it does depend on your server setup.
