= Setting up a custom Git trigger

A _custom Git trigger_ is a generic way for any Git server to act as a Build trigger. It relies solely on SSH keys and webhook endpoints. Everything else is left for the user to implement. 

[id="creating-a-custom-git-trigger"]
== Creating a trigger

Creating a custom Git trigger is similar to the creation of any other trigger, with the exception of the following:

ifeval::["{context}" == "quay-io"]
* {quayio} cannot automatically detect the proper Robot Account to use with the trigger. This must be done manually during the creation process. 
endif::[]

ifeval::["{context}" == "use-quay"]
* {productname} cannot automatically detect the proper Robot Account to use with the trigger. This must be done manually during the creation process. 
endif::[]

* There are extra steps after the creation of the trigger that must be done. These steps are detailed in the following sections. 

[id="post-git-trigger-creation-setup"]
== Custom trigger creation setup

When creating a custom Git trigger, two additional steps are required: 

. You must provide read access to the SSH public key that is generated when creating the trigger. 

ifeval::["{context}" == "quay-io"]
. You must setup a webhook that POSTs to the {quayio} endpoint to trigger the build. 
endif::[]
ifeval::["{context}" == "use-quay"]
. You must setup a webhook that POSTs to the {productname} endpoint to trigger the build. 
endif::[]

The key and the URL are available by selecting *View Credentials* from the *Settings*, or _gear_ icon.

[id="ssh-public-key-access"]
=== SSH public key access

Depending on the Git server configuration, there are multiple ways to install the SSH public key that 
ifeval::["{context}" == "quay-io"]
{quayio}
endif::[]
ifeval::["{context}" == "use-quay"]
{productname}
endif::[]
generates for a custom Git trigger.

For example, https://git-scm.herokuapp.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Getting-Git-on-a-Server[Git documentation] describes a small server setup in which adding the key to `$HOME/.ssh/authorize_keys` would provide access for Builders
to clone the repository. For any git repository management software that is not officially supported, there is usually a location to input the key often labeled as *Deploy Keys*.

[id="webhook"]
=== Webhook
To automatically trigger a build, one must `POST` a `.json` payload
to the webhook URL using the following format.

This can be accomplished in various ways depending on the
server setup, but for most cases can be done with a
https://git-scm.herokuapp.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks#idp26374144[`post-receive`
Git Hook].

[NOTE]
====
This request requires a `Content-Type` header containing
`application/json` in order to be valid.
