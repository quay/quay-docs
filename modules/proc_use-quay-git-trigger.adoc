= Setting up a Custom Git Trigger

A Custom Git Trigger is a generic way for any git server to act as a
build trigger. It relies solely on SSH keys and  webhook endpoints; everything else
is left to the user to implement.

== Creating a Trigger

Creating a Custom Git Trigger is similar to the creation of any other
trigger with a few subtle differences:

* It is not possible for {productname} to automatically detect the proper
robot account to use with the trigger. This must be done manually in the
creation process.
* There are extra steps after the creation of the trigger that must be
done in order to use the trigger. These steps are detailed below.

[[post-git-trigger-creation-setup]]
== Post trigger-creation setup

Once a trigger has been created, *there are 2 additional steps required*
before the trigger can be used:

* Provide read access to the _SSH public key_ generated when creating
the trigger.
* Setup a _webhook_ that POSTs to the {productname} endpoint to trigger a
build.

The key and the URL are both available at all times by selecting `View
Credentials` from the gear located in the trigger listing.

[[ssh-public-key-access]]
=== SSH public key access

Depending on the Git server setup, there are various ways to install the
SSH public key that {productname} generates for a custom git trigger. For
example,
https://git-scm.herokuapp.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Getting-Git-on-a-Server[Git documentation] describes a small server setup in which simply adding
the key to `$HOME/.ssh/authorize_keys` would provide access for builders
to clone the repository. For any git repository management software that
isn't officially supported, there is usually a location to input the key
often labeled as `Deploy Keys`.

[[webhook]]
=== Webhook

In order to automatically trigger a build, one must POST a JSON payload
to the webhook URL with the following format:

```
{
  "commit": "1c002dd",                                   // required
  "ref": "refs/heads/master",                            // required
  "default_branch": "master",                            // required
  "commit_info": {                                       // optional
    "url": "gitsoftware.com/repository/commits/1234567", // required
    "message": "initial commit",                         // required
    "date": "timestamp",                                 // required
    "author": {                                          // optional
      "username": "user",                                // required
      "avatar_url": "gravatar.com/user.png",             // required
      "url": "gitsoftware.com/users/user"                // required
    },
    "committer": {                                       // optional
      "username": "user",                                // required
      "avatar_url": "gravatar.com/user.png",             // required
      "url": "gitsoftware.com/users/user"                // required
    }
  }
}
```

[NOTE]
====
This request requires a `Content-Type` header containing
`application/json` in order to be valid.

Once again, this can be accomplished in various ways depending on the
server setup, but for most cases can be done via a
