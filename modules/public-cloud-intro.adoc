= Deploying {productname} on public cloud

{productname} can run on public clouds, either in standalone mode or where {ocp} itself has been deployed on public cloud. A full list of tested and supported configurations can be found in the {productname} *Tested Integrations Matrix* at link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/4067991[].

**Recommendation:** If {productname} is running on public cloud, then you should use the public cloud services for {productname} backend services to ensure proper high availability and scalability.
