= {productname} infrastructure

{productname} runs on any physical or virtual infrastructure, both on-premise or public cloud. Deployments range from simple to massively scaled, including:

* All-in-one setup on a developer laptop
* Highly available on Virtual Machines or on OpenShift
* Geographically dispersed across multiple availability zones and regions

== Running {productname} on standalone hosts

Standalone deployment is a manual process, but it can easily be automated by the customer, for example, using Ansible.  All standalone hosts require valid RHEL subscriptions.

Proof-of-concept deployment:: {productname} runs on a machine with image storage, containerized database, Redis, and optionally, Clair security scanning (scanning only works with object storage).

Highly available setups:: {productname} and Clair run in containers across multiple hosts, using `systemd` to ensure restart on failure/reboot.

High availability setups on standalone hosts require customer-provided load balancers, either low-level TCP load balancers or application load balancers capable of terminating TLS.



== Running {productname} on OpenShift

The {productname} Operator for OpenShift provides the following features:

* Automated deployment and Day 2 management of {productname}with customization options
* Management of {productname} and all its dependencies
* Automated scaling and updates
* Integration with existing OpenShift processes like GitOps, monitoring, alerting, logging
* Provision of out-of-the-box object storage with limited availability, backed by the Multi-Cloud Object Gateway (NooBaa), as part of the ODF Operator (no additional subscription required)
* Scaled-out, high availability object storage provided by the ODF Operator (additional subscription required)

{productname} can run on OpenShift infrastructure nodes, meaning no further subscriptions are required. Benefits of running {productname} on OpenShift include:

* **Zero to Hero:** Simplified deployment of {productname} and associated components means that you can start using the product immediately
* **Scalability:** Leverage cluster compute capacity to manage demand via automated scaling, based on actual load
* **Simplified Networking:** Automated provisioning of load balancers and traffic ingress secured via HTTPS using OpenShift TLS certificates and Routes  
* **Declarative configuration management:** Configurations stored in CustomResource objects for GitOps-friendly lifecycle management
* **Repeatability:** Consistency regardless of the number of replicas of {productname} / Clair
* **OpenShift integration:** Additional services to leverage OpenShift Monitoring and Alerting facilities to manage multiple Quay deployments on a single cluster

== Integrating standalone {productname} with OpenShift

While the {productname} Operator ensures seamless deployment and management of {productname} running on OpenShift, it is also possible to run {productname} in standalone mode and then serve content to one or many OpenShift clusters, wherever they are running.

A number of Operators are available to help integrate standalone Quay with OpenShift:

{productname} Cluster Security Operator:: Relays Quay vulnerability scanning results into the OpenShift Console
{productname} Bridge Operator:: Ensures seamless integration and user experience for using {productname} with OpenShift in conjunction with OpenShift Builds and ImageStreams
