= {productname} infrastructure

{productname} runs on any physical or virtual infrastructure, both on premise or public cloud. Deployments range from simple to massively scaled, like the following:

* All-in-one setup on a developer notebook
* Highly available on virtual machines or on {ocp}
* Geographically dispersed across multiple availability zones and regions

[id="arch-quay-standalone-hosts"]
== Running {productname} on standalone hosts

You can automate the standalone deployment process by using Ansible or another automation suite. All standalone hosts require valid a {rhel} subscription.

Proof of Concept deployment:: {productname} runs on a machine with image storage, containerized database, Redis, and optionally, Clair security scanning.

Highly available setups:: {productname} and Clair run in containers across multiple hosts. You can use `systemd` units to ensure restart on failure or reboot.

High availability setups on standalone hosts require customer-provided load balancers, either low-level TCP load balancers or application load balancers, capable of terminating TLS.

[id="arch-quay-openshift"]
== Running {productname} on OpenShift

The {productname} Operator for {ocp} provides the following features:

* Automated deployment and management of {productname} with customization options
* Management of {productname} and all of its dependencies
* Automated scaling and updates
* Integration with existing {ocp} processes like GitOps, monitoring, alerting, logging
* Provision of object storage with limited availability, backed by the multi-cloud object gateway (NooBaa), as part of the Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF) Operator. This service does not require an additional subscription.
* Scaled-out, high availability object storage provided by the ODF Operator. This service requires an additional subscription.

{productname} can run on {ocp} infrastructure nodes. As a result, no further subscriptions are required. Running {productname} on {ocp} has the following benefits:

* **Zero to Hero:** Simplified deployment of {productname} and associated components means that you can start using the product immediately
* **Scalability:** Use cluster compute capacity to manage demand through automated scaling, based on actual load
* **Simplified Networking:** Automated provisioning of load balancers and traffic ingress secured through HTTPS using {ocp} TLS certificates and Routes
* **Declarative configuration management:** Configurations stored in CustomResource objects for GitOps-friendly lifecycle management
* **Repeatability:** Consistency regardless of the number of replicas of {productname} and Clair
* **OpenShift integration:** Additional services to use {ocp} Monitoring and Alerting facilities to manage multiple {productname} deployments on a single cluster

== Integrating standalone {productname} with {ocp}

While the {productname} Operator ensures seamless deployment and management of {productname} running on {ocp}, it is also possible to run {productname} in standalone mode and then serve content to one or many {ocp} clusters, wherever they are running.

Several Operators are available to help integrate standalone and Operator based deployments of{productname} with {ocp}, like the following:

{productname} Cluster Security Operator:: Relays {productname} vulnerability scanning results into the {ocp} console
{productname} Bridge Operator:: Ensures seamless integration and user experience by using {productname} with {ocp} in conjunction with {ocp} Builds and ImageStreams
