= Upgrading to {productname} 3.13

With {productname} 3.13, the `volumeSize` parameter has been implemented for use with the `clairpostgres` component of the `QuayRegistry` custom resource definition (CRD). This replaces the `volumeSize` parameter that was previously used for the `clair` component of the same CRD. 

If your {productname} 3.12 `QuayRegistry` custom resource definition (CRD) implemented a volume override for the `clair` component, you must ensure that the `volumeSize` field is included under the `clairpostgres` component of the `QuayRegistry` CRD.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Failure to move `volumeSize` from the `clair` component to the `clairpostgres` component will result in a failed upgrade to version 3.13.
====

For example:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  components:
  - kind: clair
    managed: true
  - kind: clairpostgres
    managed: true
    overrides:
      volumeSize: <volume_size>
