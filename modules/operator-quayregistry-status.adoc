[id="quayregistry-current-version"]
== Viewing the version of {productname} in use

The current version of {productname} that is running will be reported in `status.currentVersion`.

[id="quayregistry-conditions"]
== Viewing the conditions of your {productname} deployment

Certain conditions will be reported in `status.conditions`.
