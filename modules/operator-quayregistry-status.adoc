= Viewing the status of the QuayRegistry object

Lifecycle observability for a given {productname} deployment is reported in the `status` section of the corresponding `QuayRegistry` object. The {productname} Operator constantly updates this section, and this should be the first place to look for any problems or state changes in {productname} or its managed dependencies.

Once {productname} is ready to be used, the `status.registryEndpoint` field will be populated with the publicly available hostname of the registry.

[id="quayregistry-current-version"]
== Viewing the version of {productname} in use

The current version of {productname} that is running will be reported in `status.currentVersion`.

[id="quayregistry-conditions"]
== Viewing the conditions of your {productname} deployment

Certain conditions will be reported in `status.conditions`.
