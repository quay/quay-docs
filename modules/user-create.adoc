= Creating user accounts

A user account for {productname} represents an individual with authenticated access to the platform's features and functionalities. Through this account, you gain the capability to create and manage repositories, upload and retrieve container images, and control access permissions for these resources. This account is pivotal for organizing and overseeing your container image management within {productname}.

Use the following procedure to create a new user for your {productname} repository. 

.Prerequisites 

* You have configured a superuser in your `config.yaml` file. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_quay/3/html-single/proof_of_concept_-_deploying_red_hat_quay/index#configuring-superuser[Configuring a {productname} superuser].

.Procedure 

. Log in to your {productname} repository as the superuser.

. In the navigation pane, select your account name, and then click *Super User Admin Panel*. 

. Click the *Users* icon in the column. 

. Click the *Create User* button. 

. Enter the new user's Username and Email address, and then click the *Create User* button. 

. You are redirected to the *Users* page, where there is now another {productname} user.

[NOTE]
====
You might need to refresh the *Users* page to show the additional user. 
====

. On the *Users* page, click the *Options* cogwheel associated with the new user. A drop-down menu appears, as shown in the following figure:
