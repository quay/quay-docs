== {productname} 3.13 known issues and limitations

The following sections note known issues and limitations for {productname} {producty}.

[id="known-issues-314"]
== {productname-ocp} multiple ingress controllers known issue

In {ocp} clusters with multiple ingress controllers defined, the {productname} Operator iterates through the list of available ingress controllers are uses the first one that it encounters to determine the cluster hostname. However, the order of ingress controllers in this list is not guaranteed to be consistent across reconciliation cycles. Consequently, the Operator might pick a different ingress controller, leading it to detect a change in the cluster hostname and initiate a new reconciliation process. This can lead to instability in `quay` pods and your {productname-ocp} deployment.

Use one of the following methods to avoid this issue:

* Set the `route` and `tls` components of the `QuayRegistry` resource to be unmanaged (`managed: false`), and create a custom Route for {productname}. For more information about creating a custom Route, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/deploying_the_red_hat_quay_operator_on_openshift_container_platform/index#operator-unmanaged-route[Disabling the Route component].
* Ensure that only one ingress controller matches the {productname} `route` resource, which can be done with ingress controller sharding. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-ver}/html-single/networking/index#nw-ingress-sharding-concept_configuring-ingress-cluster-traffic-ingress-controller[Ingress sharding in {ocp}].

[id="clair-suse-enterprise-known-issue"]
== Clair vulnerability report known issue

When pushing Suse Enterprise Linux Images with *HIGH* image vulnerabilities, Clair 4.8.0 does not report these vulnerabilities. This is a known issue and will be fixed in a future version of {productname}.

[id="fips-mode-known-issue"]
== FIPS mode known issue

If FIPS mode is enabled for your {ocp} cluster and you use Clair, you must not upgrade the {productname} Operator to version {producty}. If you upgrade, Clair will not function in your cluster. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-8185[*PROJQUAY-8185*])

[id="registry-auto-pruning-known-issue"]
== Registry auto-pruning known issues

The following known issues apply to the auto-pruning feature:

* Currently, the auto-pruning feature prioritizes the following order when configured:
+
. Method: `creation_date` + `organization wide`
. Method: `creation_date` + `repository wide`
. Method: `number_of_tags` + `organization wide`
. Method: `number_of_tags` + `repository wide`
+
This means that the auto-pruner first prioritizes, for example, an organization-wide policy set to expire tags by their creation date before it prunes images by the number of tags that it has.
+
There is a known issue when configuring a registry-wide auto-pruning policy. If {productname} administrators configure a `number_of_tags` policy before a `creation_date` policy, it is possible to prune more than the intended set for the `number_of_tags` policy. This might lead to situations where a repository removes certain image tags unexpectedly.
+
This is not an issue for organization or repository-wide auto-prune policies. This known issue only exists at the registry level. It will be fixed in a future version of {productname}.

* When creating an auto-prune policy, the pruner cannot recognize `\b` and `\B` patterns. This is a common behavior with regular expression patterns, wherein `\b` and `\B` match empty strings. {productname} administrators should avoid using _regex_ patterns that use `\B` and `\b` to avoid this issue.
