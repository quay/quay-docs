[id="downgrade-quay-deployment"]
= Downgrading {productname}

{productname} only supports rolling back, or downgrading, to previous z-stream versions, for example, 3.7.2 -> 3.7.1.  Rolling back to previous y-stream versions (3.7.0 -> 3.6.0) is not supported. This is because {productname} updates might contain database schema upgrades that are applied when upgrading to a new version of {productname}. Database schema upgrades are not considered backwards compatible.  

[IMPORTANT]
====
Downgrading to previous z-streams is neither recommended nor supported by either Operator based deployments or virtual machine based deployments. Downgrading should only be done in extreme circumstances. The decision to rollback your {productname} deployment must be made in conjunction with the {productname} support and development teams. For more information, contact {productname} support.
