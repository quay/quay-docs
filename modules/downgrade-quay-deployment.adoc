= Downgrading {productname}

{productname} only supports rolling back, or downgrading, to previous z-stream versions, for example, 3.7.2 -> 3.7.1.  Rolling back to previous y-stream versions (3.7.0 -> 3.6.0) is not supported. This is because {productname} updates might contain database schema upgrades that are applied when upgrading to a new version of {productname}. Database schema upgrades are not considered backwards compatible.
