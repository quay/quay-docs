= Modifying the configuration file by using the CLI

You can modify the `config.yaml` file that is stored by the `configBundleSecret` by using the CLI.

[NOTE]
====
Modifying the `config.yaml` file that is stored by the `configBundleSecret` is a multi-step procedure that requires base64 decoding the existing configuration file and then uploading the changes. For most cases, using the {ocp} web console to make changes to the `config.yaml` file is simpler.
