= Incorrect timestamp 

In some cases, using `docker push` might show the incorrect timestamp for one or more images. In most cases, this means that your machine or virtual machine's time has become desynchronized. 

This occurs because the timestamp shown for the _Changed_ file is generated by the Docker client when the image is created. If the time on the machine on which the image was built is out of sync, the timestamp shown is different on {productname} as well. Usually, this means that your machine needs to be synced with the link:http://www.ntp.org/[Network Time Protocol]. 

Enter the following command to force the Docker virtual machine to synchronize its clock:
[source,terminal]
----
$ docker ssh -C 'sudo ntpclient -s -h pool.ntp.org'
