== {productname} 3.12.5 bug fixes

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-8024[PROJQUAY-8024]. Previously, using Hitachi HCP v9.7 as your storage provider would return errors when attempting to pull images. This issue has been resolved.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-5086[PROJQUAY-5086]. Previously, {productname-ocp} would produce information about horizontal pod autoscalers (HPAs) for some components (for example, `Clair`, `Redis`, `PostgreSQL`, and `ObjectStorage`) when they were unmanaged by the Operator. This issue has been resolved and information about HPAs are not longer reported for unmanaged components.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-8243[PROJQUAY-8243]. Previously, the REST API was more lenient than its UI counterpart when executing certain calls. For example, using the API allows users to create team names with dashes (`-`) in them, while the web UI would now allow dashes. This issue has been resolved.
