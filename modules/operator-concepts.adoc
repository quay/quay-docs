= Introduction to the {productname} Operator

[role="_abstract"]
The {productname} Operator simplifies installation, deployment, and management of the {productname} container registry on {ocp}. You can use the Operator to treat Quay as a native {ocp} application and manage its full lifecycle.

This chapter provides a conceptual overview of the {productname} Operator's architecture and configuration model. It covers the following information:

* A configuration overview of {productname} when deployed on {ocp}.

* How the Operator manages Quay's components, or _managed components_.

* When and why to use external, or _unmanaged_, components for dependencies like the database and object storage.

* The function and structure of the `configBundleSecret`, which handles Quay's configuration.

* The prerequisites required before installation.
