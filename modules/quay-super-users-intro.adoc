= {productname} Super users 

`Super users` are a group of {productname} users with enhanced access and privileges, including: 

* Super user API calls that are not visible or accessible to normal users. 
* Access to the `Super User Admin Panel`, which allows users to
** Change a user's email address, password, delete, or disable users.
** Rename, delete, or take ownership of an organization. 
** Change expiration time, rename, or delete service keys such as Clair.
** Access to global and registry-wide usage, or audit, logs. 
** Create and send globally visible user messages. 

Primary super users are created during the initial {productname} configuration, and more can be created after configuration is complete. 

[NOTE]
====
Super users cannot delete repositories or organizations without taking ownership of them first.
