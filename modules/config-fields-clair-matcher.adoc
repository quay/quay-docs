| Field | Type | Description
| **matcher** | Object | Provides Clair matcher node configuration.

| **.cache_age** | String | Controls how long users should be hinted to cache responses for.

| **.connstring** | String | A Postgres connection string. Accepts format as a URL or libpq connection string.

| **.max_conn_pool** | Integer | Limits the database connection pool size.

Clair allows for a custom connection pool size. This number directly sets how many active database connections are allowed concurrently.

This parameter will be ignored in a future version. Users should configure this through the connection string.

| **.indexer_addr** | String  | A matcher contacts an indexer to create a `VulnerabilityReport`. The location of this indexer is required.

Defaults to `30m`.

| **.migrations** | Boolean | Whether matcher nodes handle migrations to their databases.

| **.period** | String | Determines how often updates for new security advisories take place.

Defaults to `30m`.

| **.disable_updaters** | Boolean | Whether to run background updates or not.

| **.update_retention** | Integer  | Sets the number of update operations to retain between garbage collection cycles. This should be set to a safe MAX value based on database size constraints.

Defaults to `10m`.

If a value of less than `0` is provided, garbage collection is disabled. `2` is the minimum value to ensure updates can be compared to notifications.
