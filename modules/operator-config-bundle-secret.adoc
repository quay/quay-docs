[[operator-config-bundle-secret]]
= Config bundle secret

The `spec.configBundleSecret` field is a reference to the `metadata.name` of a `Secret` in the same namespace as the `QuayRegistry`. This `Secret` must contain a `config.yaml` key/value pair. This `config.yaml` file is a Quay config YAML file. This field is optional, and will be auto-filled by the Operator if not provided. If provided, it serves as the base set of config fields which are later merged with other fields from any managed components to form a final output `Secret`, which is then mounted into the Quay application pods.
