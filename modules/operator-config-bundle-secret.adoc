= Understanding the configBundleSecret

The `spec.configBundleSecret` field is an optional reference to the name of a Secret in the same namespace as the `QuayRegistry` resource. This Secret must contain a `config.yaml` key/value pair, where the value is a {productname} configuration file.

The `configBundleSecret` stores the `config.yaml` file. {productname} administrators can define the following settings through the `config.yaml` file:

* Authentication backends (for example, OIDC, LDAP)
* External TLS termination settings
* Repository creation policies
* Feature flags
* Notification settings

{productname} might update this secret for the following reasons:

* Enable a new authentication method
* Add custom SSL/TLS certificates
* Enable features
* Modify security scanning settings

If this field is omitted, the {productname} Operator automatically generates a configuration secret based on default values and managed component settings. If the field is provided, the contents of the `config.yaml` are used as the base configuration and are merged with values from managed components to form the final configuration, which is mounted into the `quay` application pods.
