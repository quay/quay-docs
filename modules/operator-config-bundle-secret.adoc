= Understanding the configBundleSecret

The `spec.configBundleSecret` field is an optional reference to the name of a Secret in the same namespace as the `QuayRegistry` resource. This Secret must contain a `config.yaml` key/value pair, where the value is a {productname} configuration file.

The `configBundleSecret` stores the `config.yaml` file. {productname} administrators can define the following settings through the `config.yaml` file:

* Authentication backends (for example, OIDC, LDAP)
* External TLS termination settings
* Repository creation policies
* Feature flags
* Notification settings

{productname} might update this secret for the following reasons:

* Enable a new authentication method
* Add custom SSL/TLS certificates
* Enable features
* Modify security scanning settings

If this field is omitted, the {productname} Operator automatically generates a configuration secret based on default values and managed component settings. If the field is provided, the contents of the `config.yaml` are used as the base configuration and are merged with values from managed components to form the final configuration, which is mounted into the `quay` application pods.

ifeval::["{context}" == "quay-configuration"]

How the `QuayRegistry` CR is configured determines which fields must be included in the `configBundleSecret`'s `config.yaml` file for {productname-ocp}. The following example shows you a default `config.yaml` file when all components are managed by the Operator. Note that this example looks different depending on whether components are managed or unmanaged (`managed: false`).

In some cases, you might opt to manage certain components yourself, for example, object storage. In that scenario, you would modify the `QuayRegistry` CR as follows:

.Unmanaged objectstorage component
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
    - kind: objectstorage
      managed: false
# ...
----

If you are managing your own components, your deployment must be configured to include the necessary information or resources for that component. For example, if the `objectstorage` component is set to `managed: false`, you would include the relevant information depending on your storage provider inside of the `config.yaml` file. The following example shows you a distributed storage configuration using Google Cloud Storage:

.Required information when objectstorage is unmanaged
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
DISTRIBUTED_STORAGE_CONFIG:
    default:
        - GoogleCloudStorage
        - access_key: <access_key>
          bucket_name: <bucket_name>
          secret_key: <secret_key>
          storage_path: /datastorage/registry
# ...
----

Similarly, if you are managing the `horizontalpodautoscaler` component, you must create an accompanying link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/deploying_the_red_hat_quay_operator_on_openshift_container_platform/index#operator-disabling-hpa[`HorizontalPodAutoscaler` custom resource].
