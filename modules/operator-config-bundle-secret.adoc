= Config bundle secret

The `spec.configBundleSecret` field is a reference to the `metadata.name` of a `Secret` in the same namespace as the `QuayRegistry` resource. This `Secret` must contain a `config.yaml` key/value pair. 

The `config.yaml` file is a {productname} `config.yaml` file. This field is optional, and is auto-filled by the {productname} Operator if not provided. If provided, it serves as the base set of config fields which are later merged with other fields from any managed components to form a final output `Secret`, which is then mounted into the {productname} application pods.
