= {productname} bug fixes

The following issues were fixed with {productname} 3.16:

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-6106[*PROJQUAY-6106*]. Before this update, {productname} development on newer Macs was blocked due to Rehash library incompatibility with OpenSSL 3. 
+
With this release, Quay now supports OpenSSL 3, resolving compatibility issues on newer Macs and enabling UBI 9 development.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-9899[*PROJQUAY-9899*]. Before this update, the SSH client panicked due to an unexpected `SSH_AGENT_SUCCESS` response during typed response expectation. As a consequence, the SSH client terminated prematurely, potentially causing data loss or service interruption. 
+
With this release, the SSH client panic due to unexpected `SSH_AGENT_SUCCESS` response has been fixed. As a result, SSH client stability has improved, preventing early termination due to such unexpected responses.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-9889[*PROJQUAY-9889*]. Before this update, unbounded allocation occurred while parsing GNU sparse map due to lack of maximum size limit on sparse region data blocks. As a consequence, unbounded memory consumption occurred when processing maliciously crafted tar files, potentially causing application crashes or system instability. 
+
With this release, unbounded allocation in GNU sparse map parsing has been fixed, preventing memory exhaustion. As a result, memory consumption during parsing of GNU sparse map is controlled, reducing potential memory exhaustion risks.


* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-9840[*PROJQUAY-9840*], link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-9823[*PROJQUAY-9823*]. Before this update, unbounded allocation occurred while parsing GNU sparse map due to lack of maximum size limit on sparse region data blocks. As a consequence, unbounded memory consumption during parsing of sparse files potentially caused application crashes or system instability. 
+
With this release, unbounded allocation in GNU sparse map parsing has been fixed, preventing memory exhaustion. As a result, memory allocation is now bounded when parsing GNU sparse map, improving system stability.


* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-9782[*PROJQUAY-9782*]. Before this update, Axios did not check data size in `data:` scheme on Node.js, ignoring `maxContentLength`/`maxBodyLength`, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) via large data via `data:` URI causing Node.js crash. 
+
With this release, Axios DoS vulnerability is fixed by adding data size check. As a result, Axios now prevents DoS attacks via large `data:` URIs, improving memory usage and stability.


* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-9764[*PROJQUAY-9764*]. Before this update, user action of calling Decoder.Decode on deeply nested structures led to stack exhaustion, causing a security panic (follow-up to CVE-2022-30635). As a consequence, user experience was interrupted. 
+
With this release, deeply nested structures no longer cause a panic due to improved decoding. As a result, application performance is more stable.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-9502[*PROJQUAY-9502*], link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-9449[*PROJQUAY-9449*]. Before this update, the Nginx Dockerfiles continued to reference the End of Life version 1.22. As a consequence, users experienced outdated Nginx versions after Dockerfile reference remained on 1.22. With this release, the Nginx Dockerfiles have been updated to reference version 1.24. As a result, continued support for Dockerfiles beyond 2025 is ensured.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-9732[*PROJQUAY-9732*]. Before this update, the bug occurred when configuring remote registry `ghcr.io` without a valid token, resulting in `401` or `403` responses. This prevented users from saving organization config for remote registry. 
+
With this release, the fix allows saving proxy config for `ghcr.io` with `401` or `403` responses. As a result, end users can now save and configure remote registry `ghcr.io` during organization creation. 

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-9579[*PROJQUAY-9579*]. Before this update, the Quay new UI image tags management did not display the Cosign icon for signed images, due to a lack of the necessary behavior. As a consequence, users could not see the Cosign tag indication in the Quay new UI, affecting the visibility of signed images. 
+
With this release, the Quay new UI now displays the Cosign-signed tag icon, matching the behavior of the Quay Current UI. As a result, the Quay new UI correctly displays the "Signed by Cosign" icon for images.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-9525[*PROJQUAY-9525*], link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-9461[*PROJQUAY-9461*]. Before this update, the Quay new UI failed to display customized registry titles on the browser tab, causing user recognition issues. 
+
With this release, the browser tab name in the new UI now correctly displays customized registry titles. As a result, the customized registry title is displayed correctly in the Quay new UI browser tab.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-9272[*PROJQUAY-9272*], link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-9060[*PROJQUAY-9060*]. Before this update, the removal of the dropdown option for regular expression search in search fields caused the bug. As a consequence, the regular expression search option was missing from search fields, affecting user experience. 
+
With this release, the search field regular expression option is now functional again. As a result, search regular expression option has been restored, enabling advanced search functionality for users.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-7538[*PROJQUAY-7538*]. Before this update, repository path with multiple slashes caused unpacking error in `util/jinjautil.py`. As a consequence, users received incomplete email notifications for repository updates with slash-separated names. With this release, email notifications for repositories with slashes have been fixed by adjusting the repository path splitting in `util/jinjautil.py`. As a result, email notifications for repositories with slashes are now working correctly.
