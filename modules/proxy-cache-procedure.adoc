= Using {productname} to proxy a remote registry

The following procedure describes how you can use {productname} to proxy a remote registry. This procedure is set up to proxy quay.io, which allows users to use `podman` to pull any public image from any namespace on quay.io.

.Prerequisites

* `FEATURE_PROXY_CACHE` in your config.yaml is set to `true`.
* Assigned the *Member* team role. For more information about team roles, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html/use_red_hat_quay/user-org-intro[Users and organizations in {productname}].


.Procedure

. On the {productname} v2 UI, click the name of an organization, for example, *cache-org*.

. In the navigation pane, click *Settings*.

. In the *Remote Registry* box, enter the name of the remote registry to be cached, for example, `quay.io`, and click *Save*.
+
[NOTE]
====
By adding a namespace to the *Remote Registry*, for example, `quay.io/<namespace>`, users in your organization will only be able to proxy from that namespace.
====

. Optional. In the *Remote Registry username* box, enter the username for authenticating into the remote registry specified in the previous step. For anonymous pulls from the upstream, you can leave this empty. If you do note set a username at the time of creation, you cannot add one without removing the proxy cache and creating a new registry.

. Optional. In the *Remote registry password* box, enter the password for authenticating into the remote registry. For anonymous pulls from the upstream, you can leave this empty. If you do note set a username at the time of creation, you cannot add one without removing the proxy cache and creating a new registry.

. Optional. Set a time in the *Expiration* field.
+
[NOTE]
====
* The default tag *Expiration* field for cached images in a proxy organization is set to 86400 seconds. In the proxy organization, the tag expiration is refreshed to the value set in the UI's *Expiration* field every time the tag is pulled. This feature is different than Quay's default link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/use_red_hat_quay/index#tag-expiration[individual tag expiration] feature. In a proxy organization, it is possible to override the individual tag feature. When this happens, the individual tag's expiration is reset according to the *Expiration* field of the proxy organization.
* Expired images will disappear after the allotted time, but are still stored in {productname}. The time in which an image is completely deleted, or  collected, depends on the *Time Machine* setting of your organization. The default time for garbage collection is 14 days unless otherwise specified.
====

. Optional. Check the *http* box if you want an unsecure protocol used. If not checked, https is used to request the remote registry.

. Click *Save*.

.Verification

. On the CLI, pull a public image from the remote registry that was specified, for example, `quay.io`, acting as a proxy cache:
+
----
$ podman pull <registry_url>/<organization_name>/<quayio_namespace>/<image_name>
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If your organization is set up to pull from a single namespace in the remote registry, the remote registry namespace must be omitted from the URL. For example, `podman pull <registry_url>/<organization_name>/<image_name>`.
