= Configuring SSL using the command line

Use the following steps to set up Quay to handle TLS:

. Copy the certificate file and primary key file to the configuration directory, ensuring they are named `ssl.cert` and `ssl.key` respectively.

. Edit the `config.yaml` file and specify that you want Quay to handle TLS:

SERVER_HOSTNAME: quay-server.example.com
