[source,yaml]

apiVersion: quay.redhat.com/v1
kind: QuayRegistry
metadata:
  name: example-registry
  namespace: quay-enterprise
spec:
  components:
    - kind: route
      managed: false

. In your `config.yaml` file, configure {productname} to handle SSL/TLS. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
EXTERNAL_TLS_TERMINATION: false
SERVER_HOSTNAME: example-registry-quay-quay-enterprise.apps.user1.example.com
PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME: https
# ...

{
  "reason":"ConfigInvalid",
  "message":"required component `route` marked as unmanaged, but `configBundleSecret` is missing necessary fields"
}
