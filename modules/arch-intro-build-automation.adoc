{productname} supports building Dockerfiles using a set of worker nodes on OpenShift or Kubernetes. Build triggers, such as GitHub webhooks, can be configured to automatically build new versions of your repositories when new code is committed.

Prior to {productname} 3.7, Quay ran podman commands in virtual machines launched by pods. Running builds on virtual platforms requires enabling nested virtualization, which is not featured in Red Hat Enterprise Linux or OpenShift Container Platform. As a result, builds had to run on bare-metal clusters, which is an inefficient use of resources.

With {productname} 3.7, the bare-metal constraint required to run builds has been removed by adding an additional build option which does not contain the virtual machine layer. As a result, builds can be run on virtualized platforms. Backwards compatibility to run previous build configurations is also available.
