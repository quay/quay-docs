= Geo-replication using the {productname} Operator

image:178_Quay_architecture_0821_georeplication_openshift-temp.png[Geo-replication architecture]

In the example shown above, the {productname} Operator is deployed in two separate regions, with a common database and a common Redis instance. Localized image storage is provided in each region and image pulls are served from the closest available storage engine. Container image pushes are written to the preferred storage engine for the Quay instance, and will then be replicated, in the background, to the other storage engines.

Because the Operator now manages the Clair security scanner and its database separately, geo-replication setups can be leveraged so that they do not manage the Clair database. Instead, an external shared database would be used. {productname} and Clair support several providers and vendors of PostgreSQL, which can be found in the {productname} 3.x link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/4067991[test matrix]. Additionally, the Operator also supports custom Clair configurations that can be injected into the deployment, which allows users to configure Clair with the connection credentials for the external database.
