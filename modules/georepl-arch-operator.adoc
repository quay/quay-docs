= Geo-replication architecture -  Quay Operator

The following diagram shows a possible distribution of resources where Quay has been deployed on two OpenShift clusters using the Operator:

In the example shown above, Quay Operator is deployed in two separate regions, with a common database and a common Redis instance. Localized image storage is provided in each region and image pulls are served from the closest available storage engine. Container image pushes are written to the preferred storage engine for the Quay instance, and will then be replicated, in the background, to the other storage engines.
