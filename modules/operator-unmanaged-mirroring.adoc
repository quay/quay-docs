= Disabling the mirroring component

Repository mirroring in {productname} allows you to automatically synchronize container images from remote registries into your local {productname} instance. The {productname} Operator deploys a separate *mirroring worker* component that handles these synchronization tasks.

You can disable the managed mirroring component by setting it to `managed: false` in the `QuayRegistry` custom resource.

[NOTE]
====
Disabling managed mirroring means that the Operator does not deploy or reconcile any mirroring pods. You are responsible for creating, scheduling, and maintaining mirroring jobs manually. For most production deployments, leaving mirroring as `managed: true` is recommended.
