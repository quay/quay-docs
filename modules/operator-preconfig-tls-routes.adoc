= Configuring SSL/TLS and Routes

Support for {ocp} Edge-Termination Routes has been added by way of a new managed component, `tls`. This separates the `route` component from SSL/TLS and allows users to configure both separately.

`EXTERNAL_TLS_TERMINATION: true` is the opinionated setting.

* Managed `tls` means that the default cluster wildcard certificate is used.
* Unmanaged `tls` means that the user provided key and certificate pair is be injected into the `Route`.

The `ssl.cert` and `ssl.key` are now moved to a separate, persistent secret, which ensures that the key and certificate pair are not re-generated upon every reconcile. The key and certificate pair are now formatted as `edge` routes and mounted to the same directory in the `Quay` container.

Multiple permutations are possible when configuring SSL/TLS and Routes, but the following rules apply:

* If SSL/TLS is `managed`, then your route must also be `managed`
* If SSL/TLS is `unmanaged` then you must supply certificates, either with the config tool or directly in the config bundle
//* However, it is possible to have both TLS and route `unmanaged` and not supply certs.

The following table describes the valid options:

|===
|Option | Route | TLS | Certs  provided |Result
| My own load balancer handles TLS |  Managed | Managed | No |Edge Route with default wildcard cert
| {productname} handles TLS | Managed | Unmanaged | Yes | Passthrough route with certs mounted inside the pod
| {productname} handles TLS | Unmanaged | Unmanaged | Yes | Certificates are set inside the quay pod but route must be created manually
// | None (Not for production) | Unmanaged | Unmanaged | No | Sets a passthrough route, allows HTTP traffic directly from the route and into the Pod

[NOTE]
====
{productname} 3.7 does not support builders when TLS is managed by the Operator.

== Creating the config bundle secret with the SSL/TLS cert and key pair

Use the following procedure to create a config bundle secret that includes your own SSL/TLS certificate and key pair.

.Procedure

* Enter the following command to create config bundle secret that includes your own SSL/TLS certificate and key pair:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create secret generic --from-file config.yaml=./config.yaml --from-file ssl.cert=./ssl.cert --from-file ssl.key=./ssl.key config-bundle-secret
