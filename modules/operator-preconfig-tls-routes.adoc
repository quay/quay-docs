= Configuring TLS and routes

Multiple permutations are possible when configuring TLS and routes, but the following rules apply:

* If TLS is `managed`, then route must also be `managed`
* If TLS is `unmanaged` then you must supply certs, either with the config tool or directly in the config bundle
//* However, it is possible to have both TLS and route `unmanaged` and not supply certs. 

The following table outlines the valid options:

| {productname} handles TLS | Unmanaged | Unmanaged | Yes | Certificates are set inside the quay pod but route must be created manually
// | None (Not for production) | Unmanaged | Unmanaged | No | Sets a passthrough route, allows HTTP traffic directly from the route and into the Pod
