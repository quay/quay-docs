= Bulk managing robot account repository access

Use the following procedure to manage, in bulk, robot account repository access by using the {productname} v2 UI.

.Prerequisites

* You have created a robot account.
* You have created multiple repositories under a single organization.

.Procedure 

. On the {productname} v2 UI landing page, click *Organizations* in the navigation pane. 

. On the *Organizations* page, select the name of the organization that has multiple repositories. The number of repositories under a single organization can be found under the *Repo Count* column. 

. On your organization's page, click *Robot accounts*. 

. For the robot account that will be added to multiple repositories, click the kebab icon -> *Set repository permissions*. 

. On the *Set repository permissions* page, check the boxes of the repositories that the robot account will be added to. For example:

. Set the permissions for the robot account, for example, *None*, *Read*, *Write*, *Admin*. 

. Click *save*. An alert that says *Success alert: Successfully updated repository permission* appears on the *Set repository permissions* page, confirming the changes. 

. Return to the *Organizations* -> *Robot accounts* page. Now, the *Repositories* column of your robot account shows the number of repositories that the robot account has been added to.
