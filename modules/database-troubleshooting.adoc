= Troubleshooting the {productname} database

The PostgreSQL database used for {productname} store various types of information related to container images and their management. Some of the key pieces of information that the PostgreSQL database stores includes: 

* *Image Metadata*. The database stores metadata associated with container images, such as image names, versions, creation timestamps, and the user or organization that owns the image. This information allows for easy identification and organization of container images within the registry.

* *Image Tags*. {productname} allows users to assign tags to container images, enabling convenient labeling and versioning. The PostgreSQL database maintains the mapping between image tags and their corresponding image manifests, allowing users to retrieve specific versions of container images based on the provided tags.

* *Image Layers*. Container images are composed of multiple layers, which are stored as individual objects. The database records information about these layers, including their order, checksums, and sizes. This data is crucial for efficient storage and retrieval of container images.

* *User and Organization Data*. {productname} supports user and organization management, allowing users to authenticate and manage access to container images. The PostgreSQL database stores user and organization information, including usernames, email addresses, authentication tokens, and access permissions.

* *Repository Information*. {productname} organizes container images into repositories, which act as logical units for grouping related images. The database maintains repository data, including names, descriptions, visibility settings, and access control information, enabling users to manage and share their repositories effectively.

* *Event Logs*. {productname} tracks various events and activities related to image management and repository operations. These event logs, including image pushes, pulls, deletions, and repository modifications, are stored in the PostgreSQL database, providing an audit trail and allowing administrators to monitor and analyze system activities.

The content in this section covers the following procedures:

* *Checking the type of deployment*: Determine if the database is deployed as a container on a virtual machine or as a pod on {ocp}.

* *Checking the container or pod status*: Verify the status of the `database` pod or container using specific commands based on the deployment type.

* *Examining the database container or pod logs*: Access and examine the logs of the database pod or container, including commands for different deployment types.

* *Checking the connectivity between {productname} and the database pod*: Check the connectivity between {productname} and the `database` pod using relevant commands.

* *Checking the database configuration*: Check the database configuration at various levels ({ocp} or PostgreSQL level) based on the deployment type.

* *Checking resource allocation*: Monitor resource allocation for the {productname} deployment, including disk usage and other resource usage.

* *Interacting with the {productname} database*: Learn how to interact with the PostgreSQL database, including commands to access and query databases.
