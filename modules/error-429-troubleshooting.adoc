= Troubleshooting HTTP status code 429

HTTP status code `429` indicates that the user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time. If you are receiving this status code, it means that {productname} has reached its maximum capacity for requests per-second, per-IP address. To resolve this issue, you can take the following steps:

* Reduce the frequency or pace at which you are sending requests to your {productname} registry. This helps ensure that you stay within the allowed limits and avoid triggering a `429` response. 

* Implement a back-off strategy to wait and retry the request after a certain period of time. Back-off strategies involve increasing the waiting time between subsequent requests. This gives the server enough time to process previous requests, which avoids overwhelming the server. 

* Use caching mechanisms to store and reuse frequently accessed data from the {productname} registry. This can help reduce the need for repeated requests and improve overall performance.
