== {productname} 3.15.1 bug fixes

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-9135[PROJQUAY-9135]. Before this update, Alembic migrations failed to install certificates during run, causing issues with {productname} behind HTTPS proxy due to lack of certificates. Consequently, users experienced migration failure when {productname} was behind an HTTPS proxy. With this release, Alembic migrations no longer require manual certificate installation for {productname} behind HTTPS proxy. As a result, Alembic migrations can now install certs, allowing smooth operation behind HTTPS proxies.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-9156[PROJQUAY-9156]. Previously, some `read-only` permissions were missing for `read-only` superusers. This issue has been resolved.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-9106[PROJQUAY-9106]. Previously, a bad proxy cache reference occurred due to an oversight. Consequently, users experienced stale cache data. With this release, the proxy cache reference issue is resolved, ensuring smoother performance for end users.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-9059[PROJQUAY-9059]. With this release, model card rendering is now enabled on the v2 UI by default. You no longer need to set the `FEATURE_UI_MODELCARD` field to `True`.
