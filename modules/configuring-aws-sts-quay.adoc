= Configuring AWS STS for {productname}

Support for Amazon Web Services (AWS) Security Token Service (STS) is available for standalone {productname} deployments, {productname-ocp}, and Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA). AWS STS is a web service for requesting temporary, limited-privilege credentials for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users and for users that you authenticate, or _federated users_. This feature is useful for clusters using Amazon S3 as an object storage, allowing {productname} to use STS protocols to authenticate with Amazon S3, which can enhance the overall security of the cluster and help to ensure that access to sensitive data is properly authenticated and authorized. 

Configuring AWS STS for {ocp} or ROSA requires creating an AWS IAM user, creating an S3 role, and configuring your {productname} `config.yaml` file to include the proper resources.

Use the following procedures to configure AWS STS for {productname}.
