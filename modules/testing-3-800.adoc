[[testing-3-800]]
== Testing 3.8.0 features 

The following sections in this guide explain how to enable new features and test that they are working. 

[[enabling-ipv6-dual-stack]]
=== Enabling and testing the IPv6 and dual-stack protocol family on standalone {productname} deployments 

Your {productname} deployment can now be served in locations that only support IPv6, such as Telco and Edge environments. Support is also offered for dual-stack networking so your {productname} deployment can listen on IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously.

[[enabling-ipv6]]
==== Enabling and testing IPv6 

Use the following procedure to enable IPv6 on your standalone {productname} deployment. 

.Prerequisites 

* You have updated {productname} to 3.8.
* Your host and container software platform (Docker, Podman) must be configured to support IPv6. 

.Procedure 

. In your deployment's `config.yaml` file, add the `FEATURE_LISTEN_IP_VERSION` parameter and set it to `IPv6`, for example: 
+
[source,yaml]
----
---
FEATURE_GOOGLE_LOGIN: false
FEATURE_INVITE_ONLY_USER_CREATION: false
FEATURE_LISTEN_IP_VERSION: IPv6
FEATURE_MAILING: false
FEATURE_NONSUPERUSER_TEAM_SYNCING_SETUP: false
---
----

. Start, or restart, your {productname} deployment. 

. Check that your deployment is listening to IPv6. 
+
.. For a standalone deployment, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl <quay_endpoint>/health/instance
{"data":{"services":{"auth":true,"database":true,"disk_space":true,"registry_gunicorn":true,"service_key":true,"web_gunicorn":true}},"status_code":200}
----
+
.. For an Operator based deployment, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl <quay_endpoint>/health/instance
{"data":{"services":{"auth":true,"database":true,"disk_space":true,"registry_gunicorn":true,"service_key":true,"web_gunicorn":true}},"status_code":200}
----

===== Expected Results 

After enabling IPv6 in your deployment's `config.yaml`, all {productname} features can be used as normal, so long as your environment is configured to use IPv6 and is not hindered by the ipv6-limitations[current limitations]. 

[WARNING]
====
If your environment is configured to IPv4, but the `FEATURE_LISTEN_IP_VERSION` configuration field is set to `IPv6`, {productname} will fail to deploy. 
====

You can use the following procedure to test that your {productname} deployment can push and pull images in an IPv6 environment. 

.Procedure

. Pull a sample image from an external registry: 
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman pull busybox
----

. Tag the image: 
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman tag docker.io/library/busybox quay-server.example.com/quayadmin/busybox:test
----

. Push the image to your {productname} registry: 
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman push --tls-verify=false quay-server.example.com/quayadmin/busybox:test
----

. Test access to the image from the CLI by deleting your local copy of the image: 
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman rmi quay-server.example.com/quayadmin/busybox:test
----

. Pull the image from your {productname} registry:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman pull --tls-verify=false quay-server.example.com/quayadmin/busybox:test
----

FEATURE_LISTEN_IP_VERSION: dual-stack
FEATURE_MAILING: false
FEATURE_NONSUPERUSER_TEAM_SYNCING_SETUP: false
---
----

. Start, or restart, your {productname} deployment. 

. Check that your deployment is listening to both channels by entering the following command:
.. For IPv4, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl --ipv4 <quay_endpoint>
{"data":{"services":{"auth":true,"database":true,"disk_space":true,"registry_gunicorn":true,"service_key":true,"web_gunicorn":true}},"status_code":200}
----
.. For IPv6, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]

[[enabling-ui-v2]]
=== Enabling and testing `FEATURE_UI_V2`

With this feature enabled, you can toggle between the current version of the user interface, and the new version of the user interface. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
* This UI is currently in beta and subject to change. In its current state, users can only create, view, and delete organizations, repositories, and image tags. 
* When running {productname} in the old UI, timed-out sessions would require that the user input their password again in the pop-up window. With the new UI, users are returned to the main page and required to input their username and password credentials. This is a known issue and will be fixed in a future version of the new UI. 
* There is a discrepancy in how image manifest sizes are reported between the legacy UI and the new UI. In the legacy UI, image manifests were reported in mebibytes. In the new UI, {productname} uses the standard definition of megabyte (MB) to report image manifest sizes.

=== Leveraging storage quota limits in proxy organizations 

With {productname} 3.8, the proxy cache feature has been enhanced with an auto-pruning feature for tagged images. The auto-pruning of image tags is only available when a proxied namespace has quota limitations configured. Currently, if an image size is greater than quota for an organization, the image is skipped from being uploaded until an administrator creates the necessary space. Now, when an image is pushed that exceeds the allotted space, the auto-pruning enhancement marks the least recently used tags for deletion. As a result, the new image tag is stored, while the least used image tag is marked for deletion. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
* As part of the auto-pruning feature, the tags that are marked for deletion are eventually garbage collected by the garbage collector (gc) worker process. As a result, the quota size restriction is not fully enforced during this period. 
* Currently, the namespace quota size computation does not take into account the size for manifest child. This is a known issue and will be fixed in a future version of {productname}. 
====

==== Testing the storage quota limits feature in proxy organizations 

Use the following procedure to test the auto-pruning feature of an organization with proxy cache and storage quota limitations enabled.

.Prerequisites 

* Your organization is configured to serve as a proxy organization. The following example proxies from quay.io. 

* `FEATURE_PROXY_CACHE` is set to `true` in your `config.yaml` file. 

* `FEATURE_QUOTA_MANAGEMENT` is set to `true` in your `config.yaml` file. 

* Your organization is configured with a quota limit, for example, `150 MB`. 

.Procedure 

. Pull an image to your repository from your proxy organization, for example:
+
----
$ podman pull quay-server.example.com/proxytest/projectquay/clair:4.2.3
----

. Depending on the space left in your repository, you might need to pull additional images from your proxy organization, for example:
+
----
$ podman pull quay-server.example.com/proxytest/projectquay/clair:4.1.5
----

. In the {productname} registry UI, click the name of your repository.

* Click *Tags* in the navigation pane and ensure that `clair:4.2.3` and `clair:4.1.5` are tagged. 

. Pull the last image that will result in your repository exceeding the allotted quota, for example:
+
----
$ podman pull quay-server.example.com/proxytest/projectquay/clair:4.1.4
----

. Refresh the *Tags* page of your {productname} registry. The first image that you pushed, for example, `clair:4.2.3` should have been auto-pruned. The *Tags* page should now show `clair:4.2.3` and `clair:4.1.4`.
