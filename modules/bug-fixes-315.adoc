= {productname} bug fixes

The following issues were fixed with {productname} 3.15:

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-9050[*PROJQUAY-9050*]. Previously, when in *Tag* view on the v2 UI, the *Pull* column was center-aligned while the other columns were left-aligned. With this release, the *Pull* column is left-aligned.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-6862[*PROJQUAY-6862*]. Previously, when {productname} was deployed with Google Cloud Storage (GCS) as its object storage backend, pushing layers greater than 4 GiB would fail and return a `413` error. This error occurred because {productname}'s library, boto, does not support multipart uploads to GCS. This issue has been resolved, and users can now push layers greater than 4 GiB to their registry without interruption.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-8123[*PROJQUAY-8123*]. Previously, if a {productname} administrator set up their deployment on a virtual machine (VM) and the administrator created the `config.yaml` file manually, there was a possibility that the `TESTING` flag was not included in the configuration. Including the `TESTING: true` field in the `config.yaml` file disables some features, such as sending emails. This is useful for developers who are testing {productname} and do not want to accidentally send out notifications or other alerts to users. When this field is not set, {productname} operates normally. 
+
With this update, a warning is printed upon startup, notifying the {productname} administrator that the `TESTING` property is either missing from the `config.yaml` file entirely, or that it is set to `True`. This alert is intended to help guide administrators towards intentional configurations for their deployment.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-8595[*PROJQUAY-8595*]. Previously, {productname} would not start if Splunk had an outage. Now, {productname} pods reconcile appropriately if Splunk has an outage and, as a result, {productname} starts as intended.
