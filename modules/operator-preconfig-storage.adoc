= Configuring object storage

You need to configure object storage before installing {productname}, irrespective of whether you are allowing the Operator to manage the storage or managing it yourself. 

If you want the Operator to be responsible for managing storage, see the section on xref:operator-managed-storage[Managed storage] for information on installing and configuring the NooBaa / RHOCS Operator.

If you are using a separate storage solution, set  `objectstorage` as `unmanaged` when configuring the Operator. See the following section. xref:operator-unmanaged-storage[Unmanaged storage], for details of configuring existing storage.
