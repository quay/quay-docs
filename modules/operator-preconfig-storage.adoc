= Configuring object storage

You need to configure object storage before installing {productname}, irrespective of whether you are allowing the {productname} Operator to manage the storage or managing it yourself.

If you want the {productname} Operator to be responsible for managing storage, see the section on xref:operator-managed-storage[Managed storage] for information on installing and configuring NooBaa and the Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundations Operator.

If you are using a separate storage solution, set  `objectstorage` as `unmanaged` when configuring the Operator. See the following section. xref:operator-unmanaged-storage[Unmanaged storage], for details of configuring existing storage.
