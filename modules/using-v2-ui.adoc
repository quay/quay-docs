= Using the v2 UI

ifeval::["{context}" == "quay-io"]
The {quayio} v2 UI is enabled by default, and can be toggled on or off at a user's discretion.

== v2 user interface configuration
ifeval::["{context}" == "quay-io"]
On {quayio}, you can toggle between the current version of the user interface and the new version of the user interface.
endif::[]

ifeval::["{context}" == "use-quay"]
With `FEATURE_UI_V2` enabled, you can toggle between the current version of the user interface and the new version of the user interface. 
endif::[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
* This UI is currently in beta and subject to change. In its current state, users can only create, view, and delete organizations, repositories, and image tags. 
* When using the old UI, timed-out sessions would require that the user input their password again in the pop-up window. With the new UI, users are returned to the main page and required to input their username and password credentials. This is a known issue and will be fixed in a future version of the new UI. 
* There is a discrepancy in how image manifest sizes are reported between the legacy UI and the new UI. In the legacy UI, image manifests were reported in mebibytes. The v2 UI uses the standard definition of megabyte (MB) to report image manifest sizes. 
====
