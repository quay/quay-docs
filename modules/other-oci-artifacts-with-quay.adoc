= Adding other OCI media types to Quay

Helm, cosign, and ztsd compression scheme artifacts are built into {productname} {producty} by default. For any other OCI media type that is not supported by default, you can add them to the `ALLOWED_OCI_ARTIFACT_TYPES` configuration in Quay's config.yaml using the following format: 

....
ALLOWED_OCI_ARTIFACT_TYPES: 
  <oci config type 1>:
  - <oci layer type 1>
  - <oci layer type 2>
    
  <oci config type 2>:
  - <oci layer type 3>
  - <oci layer type 4>
...
....

For example, you can add Singularity (SIF) support by adding the following to your config.yaml: 

....
...
ALLOWED_OCI_ARTIFACT_TYPES:
  application/vnd.oci.image.config.v1+json
  - application/vnd.dev.cosign.simplesigning.v1+json
  application/vnd.cncf.helm.config.v1+json
  - application/tar+gzip
  application/vnd.sylabs.sif.config.v1+json
  - application/vnd.sylabs.sif.layer.v1+tar
...
....

[NOTE]
====
When adding OCI media types that are not configured by default, users will also need to manually add support for cosign and Helm if desired. The ztsd compression scheme is supported by default, so users will not need to add that OCI media type to their config.yaml to enable support.
