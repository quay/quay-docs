= Disabling robot accounts 

{productname} administrators can manage robot accounts by disallowing users to create new robot accounts.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Robot accounts are mandatory for repository mirroring. Setting the `ROBOTS_DISALLOW` configuration field to `true` breaks mirroring configurations. Users mirroring repositories should not set `ROBOTS_DISALLOW` to `true` in their `config.yaml` file. This is a known issue and will be fixed in a future release of {productname}.
====

////
Additionally, {productname} administrators can add robot accounts to allowlists when disallowing the creation of new robot accounts. This ensures operability of approved robot accounts and a seamless workflow in mirroring configurations.


[IMPORTANT]
====
Robot accounts are mandatory for repository mirroring. Setting the `ROBOTS_DISALLOW` configuration field to `true` without allowlisting supplementary robot accounts breaks mirroring configurations. You must allowlist robot accounts with the `ROBOTS_WHITELIST` variable when managing robot accounts with the `ROBOTS_DISALLOW` field.
====
////

Use the following procedure to disable robot account creation.

.Prerequisites 

* You have created multiple robot accounts. 

.Procedure 

. Update your `config.yaml` field to add the `ROBOTS_DISALLOW` variable, for example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
ROBOTS_DISALLOW: true
----

. Restart your {productname} deployment.

.Verification: Creating a new robot account

. Navigate to your {productname} repository.

. Click the name of a repository.

. In the navigation pane, click *Robot Accounts*. 

. Click *Create Robot Account*. 

. Enter a name for the robot account, for example, `<organization-name/username>+<robot-name>`.

. Click *Create robot account* to confirm creation. The following message appears: `Cannot create robot account. Robot accounts have been disabled. Please contact your administrator.`

.Verification: Pushing an image with an allowlisted robot account

. On the command-line interface (CLI) log in as one of the allowlisted robot accounts by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman login -u="<org_name>+<robot1>" -p="KETJ6VN0WT8YLLNXUJJ4454ZI6TZJ98NV41OE02PC2IQXVXRFQ1EJ36V12345678" <quay-server.example.com>
----

. Enter the following command to pull an example image:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman pull busybox
----

. Tag the image by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman tag docker.io/library/busybox <quay-server.example.com>/<repository_name>/busybox:test
----

. Push the image by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman push --tls-verify=false <quay-server.example.com>/<repository_name>/busybox:test

.Verification: Logging into a robot account

. On the command-line interface (CLI), attempt to log in as one of the robot accounts by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman login -u="<organization-name/username>+<robot-name>" -p="KETJ6VN0WT8YLLNXUJJ4454ZI6TZJ98NV41OE02PC2IQXVXRFQ1EJ36V12345678" <quay-server.example.com>
