== {productname} 3.10.3 bug fixes

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-4849[PROJQUAY-4849]. Previously, the exporter failed to update the lifetime end of child manifests in the main manifest lists. Consequently, this led to exceptions when attemping to pull Docker images by tag after the tag was removed from the database due to garbage collection. This issue has been resolved. 

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-6007[PROJQUAY-6007]. Previously, the Operator would attempt to create a temporary fake route to check if the cluster supported the _Route_ API. This check was unable to be conducted when the route and TLS component were marked as unamanged because these components are supposed to be managed manually by the user. This issue has been resolved.
