== Version 3.4.0

=== quay / clair-jwt / quay-builder / clair

Added/Changed:

* Clair V4 now GA and the default security scanner for Quay 3.4.0.  New features include support for notifications and disconnected deployments.
* New ConfigTool replaces the older Config App, providing better configuration validation and integration with the new Quay Operator.  Quay now uses same validator as the ConfigTool at start time to ensure its configuration is correct.  You will see a table of configuration validation status (pass/fail) now when Quay boots up.
* Quay Builders are now supported only on OpenShift/Kubernetes and utilize Red Hat CoreOS for builder sandbox VMs.  Quay Build Manager completely re-written to use gRPC and address numerous issues.  EC2-based builders are available but not supported with Red Hat Quay (as they continue to use Fedora CoreOS for the builder sandbox VM).
* Quay codebase now completely migrated to python 3 with numerous dependency updates.
* (Tech Preview) Support for Helm V3 is no longer considered experimental.  It can be enabled as follows:
+
```
# Enable Helm support- requires that general OCI support (Tech Preview) is enabled.
FEATURE_GENERAL_OCI_SUPPORT: True
FEATURE_HELM_OCI_SUPPORT: True
```

Note:

There is no simple way to exclude these source containers using Quay's current tag patterns.  This will be addressed in future Quay versions.
