[[rn-3-400]]
== Version 3.4.0

=== quay / clair / quay-builder

Added/Changed:

* Clair V4 now GA and the default security scanner for Quay 3.4.0.  New features include support for notifications and disconnected deployments.
* New ConfigTool replaces the older Config App, providing better configuration validation and integration with the new Quay Operator.  Quay now uses same validator as the ConfigTool at start time to ensure its configuration is correct.  You will see a table of configuration validation status (pass/fail) now when Quay boots up.
* Quay codebase now completely migrated to python 3 with numerous dependency updates.
* (Tech Preview) Support for Helm V3 is no longer considered experimental.  It can be enabled as follows:
+
```
# Enable Helm support- requires that general OCI support (Tech Preview) is enabled.
FEATURE_GENERAL_OCI_SUPPORT: True
FEATURE_HELM_OCI_SUPPORT: True
```
* (Tech Preview) Due to necessary changes, the existing Red Hat Quay builders had to be removed and entirely rewritten. This has resulted in a loss of functionality so the new builders are being released as link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview]. Currently, builds are only available on OpenShift/Kubernetes utilizing Red Hat CoreOS for the sandbox VMs. The internal build manager has also been completely re-written to use gRPC and numerous core issues have been addressed. Please follow the provided documentation carefully when setting up.
* NooBaa has graduated from Technical Preview (TP) and now has General Availability (GA) status.

There is no simple way to exclude these source containers using Quay's current tag patterns.  This will be addressed in future Quay versions.
