[[rn-3-002]]
== Version 3.0.2
Release Date: May 20, 2019

Fixed:

* Running {productname} in config mode now works in a disconnected option which doesn't require pulling resources from the Internet.
* {productname}'s security scan endpoint is now enabled at startup for viewing results of Clair container image scans.
* A flaw was found in the way the DES/3DES cipher was used as part of the TLS/SSL protocol. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to recover some plaintext data by capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between TLS/SSL server and client if the communication used a DES/3DES based ciphersuite. (CVE-2016-2183)

[[rn-3-000]]
== Version 3.0.0
Release Date: May 1, 2019

{productname} V3 offers the following new features:

=== {productname} Web UI configuration tool

A new {productname} configuration tool option within the quay image lets
you create {productname} configuration files before starting a {productname}
installation. The result of the configuration tool is a tarball of
{productname} configuration files. Using that tarball greatly simplifies
multi-instance deployments. The tarball contains the config.yaml file,
and any optional files such as  an SSL certificate (ssl.cert) and
SSL key (ssl.key).

Choosing between the two different configuration tool options, you can
either create a configuration file from scratch or modify an existing set
of configuration files. In both cases, after you create the configuration,
you can carry the tarball to each machine in your new {productname} cluster
or apply it on an OpenShift or other Kubernetes cluster
to  use it to actually deploy {productname}.

The new {productname} configuration tool greatly simplifies the
deployment of {productname} on OpenShift and other Kubernetes platforms.
Using this tool helps you automatically deploy changes to nodes and
can trigger Kubernetes blue-grean deployments of {productname} containers
for configuration updates.

=== Support for Windows Container Images
Windows containers offer a way to run applications written for Microsoft Windows
server platforms on container-enabled platforms, such as OpenShift and
Kubernetes. By supporting Windows containers, {productname} V3 allows you to store
your Windows containers in your {productname} registry using the same kinds of
tools you use to push and pull your Linux containers.

=== Multi-Architecture Container Image Support
{productname} V3 now supports multi-architecture container manifests.
The Docker Registry API spec v2_s2 container specification supports multi-architecture
containers by adding an architecture label to the image manifest. Having this field
set for a particular architecture allows images of the same architecture type to be
pushed to a {productname} repository and later automatically accessed from a {productname}
repository, while still requesting generic names for containers. Supported
architectures IBM Power LE and z System workloads, ARM based IoT devices
and Windows-based workloads.

=== Built on Red Hat Enterprise Linux
As part of the process of moving {productname} toward fully integrating into the
Red Hat Product lineup, {productname} V3 is now delivered in a Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 7.x container image. Moving {productname} into a RHEL container does not in
any way change the interface or general functioning of the container, but simply
allows {productname} to become better aligned with other Red Hat product offerings.

=== {productname} images now in redhat repo on Quay.io
{productname} images formerly stores in the quay.io/coreos repository are moving
to {productrepo} for {productname} version 3. Available images include:

* {productrepo}/quay
* {productrepo}/quay-builder
* {productrepo}/clair-jwt

Earlier version of quay and quay-builder images will remain on quay.io/coreos. For example, quay.io/coreos/quay:v2.9.5.

Container Images based on RHEL inherit all certification and support features from RHEL. They can also take advantage of quickly leveraging security fixes and updates as they become available in RHEL.

=== Changes to support running containers in unprivileged mode
Previous versions of images required running in privileged mode. To remove this restriction, container config and ports were changed.

* clair-jwt config has moved from /config to /clair/config
* You must update references to additional files, such as certificates, in clair-jwt's config.
* The quay HTTP port is now 8080. The HTTPS port is 8443.
* If you use the proxy port on quay, it has been moved to 7443.

The move to a RHEL base image means the certificate install path has changed to /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors. Examples running the images have been updated to reflect this.
