`SSLError` usually occurs after multiple certificates signing the same thing are added to your {productname} deployment. This error is most commonly seen on regular pushes and LDAP connectivity, even when outside sources are used, for example, AWS storage buckets. 

As a workaround for this issue, remove certificates from the `extra_ca_certs` one by one until you find the duplicate. After each removal, restart the `Quay` pod to test whether the issue persists.
