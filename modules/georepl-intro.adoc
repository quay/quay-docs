[NOTE]
====
Currently, the geo-replication feature is not supported on IBM Power.
====

Geo-replication allows multiple, geographically distributed {productname} deployments to work as a single registry from the perspective of a client or user. It significantly improves push and pull performance in a globally-distributed {productname} setup. Image data is asynchronously replicated in the background with transparent failover and redirect for clients.

Deployments of {productname} with geo-replication is supported on standalone and Operator deployments.
