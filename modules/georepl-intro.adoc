= Geo-replication

[role="_abstract"]
Geo-replication lets multiple geographically distributed {productname} deployments work as a single registry from the client perspective. This improves push and pull performance in globally distributed setups and provides transparent failover and redirect for clients.

Geo-replication is supported on standalone and Operator-based deployments.
