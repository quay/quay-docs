= Automatically building Dockerfiles with Build workers

{productname} supports building Dockerfiles using a set of worker nodes on OpenShift or Kubernetes. Build triggers, such as GitHub webhooks can be configured to automatically build new versions of your repositories when new code is committed. This document will walk you through enabling builds with your {productname} installation and setting up one or more OpenShift/K8s clusters to accept builds from {productname}.
With {productname} 3.4, the underlying Build Manager has been completely re-written as part of {productname}'s migration from Python 2 to Python 3.  As a result, builder nodes are now dynamically created as Kubernetes Jobs versus builder nodes that ran continuously in {productname} 3.3 and earlier.  This greatly simplifies how {productname} manages builds and provides the same mechanism quay.io utilizes to handle thousands of container image builds daily.  Customers who are currently running static (“Enterprise” builders under {productname} 3.3) will be required to migrate to a Kubernetes-based build mechanism. 

[[architecture-overview]]
== Architecture Overview
The {productname} Build system is designed for scalability (since it is used to host all builds at quay.io).  The Build Manager component of {productname} provides an orchestration layer that tracks build requests and ensures that a Build Executor (OpenShift/K8s cluster) will carry out each request.  Each build is handled by a Kubernetes Job which launches a small virtual machine to completely isolate and contain the image build process.  This ensures that container builds do not affect each other or the underlying build system.  Multiple Executors can be configured to ensure that builds are performed even in the event of infrastructure failures.  {productname} will automatically send builds to a different Executor if it detects that one Executor is having difficulties.

[NOTE]
====
The upstream version of Red Hat Quay provides instructions on how to configure an AWS/EC2 based Executor.  This configuration is not supported for Red Hat Quay customers.
====
endif::downstream[]

=== Build manager
The build manager is responsible for the lifecycle of scheduled build. Operations requiring updating the build queue, build phase and running jobs’ status is handled by the build manager.

=== Build workers’ control plane
Build jobs are run on separate worker nodes, and are scheduled on separate control planes (executor). Currently, {productname} supports running jobs on AWS and Kubernetes. Builds are executed using quay.io/quay/quay-builder. On AWS, builds are scheduled on EC2 instances. On k8s, the builds are scheduled as job resources.

=== Orchestrator
The orchestrator is used to store the state of currently running build jobs, and publish events for the build manager to consume. e.g expiry events. Currently, the supported orchestrator backend is Redis.


[[openshift-requirements]]
== OpenShift Requirements
{productname} builds are supported on Kubernetes and OpenShift 4.5 and higher.  A bare metal (non-virtualized) worker node is required since build pods require the ability to run kvm virtualization.  Each build is done in an ephemeral virtual machine to ensure complete isolation and security while the build is running.  In addition, your OpenShift cluster should permit the ServiceAccount associated with {productname} builds to run with the necessary SecurityContextConstraint to support privileged containers.


[[orchestrator-requirements]]
== Orchestrator Requirements
The {productname} builds need access to a Redis instance to track build status information.  It is acceptable to use the same Redis instance already deployed with your {productname} installation.  All build queues are managed in the {productname} database so there is no need for a highly available Redis instance.



[[setting-up-builders]]
== Setting Up {productname} Builders With OpenShift

=== Prepare OpenShift for {productname} Builds
There are several actions that are needed on an OpenShift cluster before it can accept builds from {productname}.

. Create a project where builds will be run (e.g. ‘builder’)
+
```
$ oc create project builder
```
+
. Create a `ServiceAccount` in this `Project` that will be used to run builds.  Ensure it has sufficient privileges to create `Jobs` and `Pods`.  Copy the `ServiceAccount`’s token for use later.
+
```
$ oc create sa -n builder quay-builder
$ oc policy add-role-to-user -n builder edit system:serviceaccount:builder:quay-builder
$ oc sa get-token -n builder quay-builder
```
+
. Identify the URL for the OpenShift cluster’s API server.  This can be found from the OpenShift Console.
. Identify a worker node label to be used when scheduling build `Jobs`.  Because build pods need to run on baremetal worker nodes, typically these are identified withi specific labels.  Check with your cluster administrator to determine exactly which node label should be used.
. If the cluster is using a self-signed certificate, get the kube apiserver’s CA to add to {productname}’s extra certs.
.. Get the name of the secret containing the CA:
+
```
$ oc get sa openshift-apiserver-sa --namespace=openshift-apiserver -o json | jq '.secrets[] | select(.name | contains("openshift-apiserver-sa-token"))'.name
```
+
.. Get the `ca.crt` key value from the secret in the Openshift console. The value should begin with “-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----”
.. Import the CA in {productname} using the ConfigTool
. Create the necessary security contexts/role bindings for the `ServiceAccount`:

Each configuration field is explained below.

ALLOWED_WORKER_COUNT:: Defines how many Build Workers are instantiated per {productname} Pod.  Typically this is ‘1’.
ORCHESTRATOR_PREFIX:: Defines a unique prefix to be added to all Redis keys (useful to isolate Orchestrator values from other Redis keys).
REDIS_HOST:: Hostname for your Redis service.
REDIS_PASSWORD:: Password to authenticate into your Redis service.
REDIS_SSL:: Defines whether or not your Redis connection uses SSL.
REDIS_SKIP_KEYSPACE_EVENT_SETUP:: By default, {productname} does not set up the keyspace events required for key events at runtime. To do so, set REDIS_SKIP_KEYSPACE_EVENT_SETUP to false.
EXECUTOR:: Starts a definition of an Executor of this type.  Valid values are ‘kubernetes’ and ‘ec2’
BUILDER_NAMESPACE:: Kubernetes namespace where {productname} builds will take place
K8S_API_SERVER:: Hostname for API Server of OpenShift cluster where builds will take place
KUBERNETES_DISTRIBUTION:: Indicates which type of Kubernetes is being used.  Valid values are ‘openshift’ and ‘k8s’.
CONTAINER_*:: Define the resource requests and limits for each build pod.
NODE_SELECTOR_*:: Defines the node selector label name/value pair where build Pods should be scheduled.
CONTAINER_RUNTIME:: Specifies whether the builder should run `docker` or `podman`.  Customers using Red Hat’s `quay-builder` image should set this to `podman`.
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME/SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN:: Defines the Service Account name/token that will be used by build Pods.
QUAY_USERNAME/QUAY_PASSWORD:: Defines the registry credentials needed to pull the {productname} build worker image.

ifdef::downstream[]
registry.redhat.io/quay/quay-builder
endif::downstream[]
WORKER_TAG:: Tag for the builder image desired.
ifdef::upstream[]
Typically this is latest.
endif::upstream[]
ifdef::downstream[]
The latest version is v3.4.0.
endif::downstream[]
BUILDER_VM_CONTAINER_IMAGE:: The full reference to the container image holding the internal VM needed to run each {productname} build
ifdef::upstream[]
(`quay.io/quay/quay-builder-qemu-fedoracoreos:latest`).
endif::upstream[]
ifdef::downstream[]
(`registry.redhat.io/quay/quay-builder-qemu-rhcos:v3.4.0`).
endif::downstream[]
SETUP_TIME:: Specifies the number of seconds at which a build times out if it has not yet registered itself with the Build Manager (default is 500 seconds).  Builds that time out are attempted to be restarted three times.  If the build does not register itself after three attempts it is considered failed.
MINIMUM_RETRY_THRESHOLD:: This setting is used with multiple Executors; it indicates how many retries are attempted to start a build before a different Executor is chosen.  Setting to 0 means there are no restrictions on how many tries the build job needs to have.  This value should be kept intentionally small (three or less) to ensure failovers happen quickly in the event of infrastructure failures.
E.g Kubernetes is set as the first executor and EC2 as the second executor. If we want the last attempt to run a job to always be executed on EC2 and not Kubernetes, we would set the Kubernetes executor’s `MINIMUM_RETRY_THRESHOLD` to 1 and EC2’s `MINIMUM_RETRY_THRESHOLD` to 0 (defaults to 0 if not set).
In this case, kubernetes’ `MINIMUM_RETRY_THRESHOLD` > retries_remaining(1) would evaluate to False, thus falling back to the second executor configured
SSH_AUTHORIZED_KEYS:: List of ssh keys to bootstrap in the ignition config. This allows other keys to be used to ssh into the EC2 instance or QEMU VM

ifdef::upstream[]
== Setting Up {productname} Builders with AWS
In addition to OpenShift, {productname} can also be configured to use AWS EC2 instances as build worker nodes.  This is useful for situations where you may want to have EC2 based builds available as a backup solution in the event your OpenShift build workers are overloaded or unavailable.

The setup steps are identical to OpenShift based builds with the following changes in your {productname} configuration bundle.

[source,yaml]

     SSH_AUTHORIZED_KEYS:
     - ssh-rsa 12345 someuser@email.com
     - ssh-rsa 67890 someuser2@email.com
----

COREOS_AMI:: Specifies an AMI name where builds will be run.  Unlike the OpenShift based builds, these container builds are done directly within an ephemeral EC2 instance.  This AMI must utilize ignition and contain a docker.  The AMI shown in this example is used by quay.io for its build system.

[NOTE]
====
AWS builds are not supported by Red Hat and are currently provided as an upstream feature only.

endif::upstream[]

== OpenShift Routes Limitation

[NOTE]
====
This section only applies if you are using the Quay Operator on OpenShift with managed `route` component.
====

Due to a limitation of OpenShift `Routes` to only be able to serve traffic to a single port, additional steps are required to set up builds. Ensure your `kubectl`/`oc` CLI tool is configured to work with the cluster which the Quay Operator is installed and your `QuayRegistry` exists (not necessarily the same as the bare-metal cluster where your builders run).

* Ensure that HTTP/2 ingress is enabled on the OpenShift cluster by following link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.5/networking/ingress-operator.html#nw-http2-haproxy_configuring-ingress[these steps].

* The Quay Operator will create a `Route` which directs gRPC traffic to the build manager server running inside the existing Quay pod(s). If you want to use a custom hostname (such as a subdomain like `builder.registry.example.com`), ensure that you create a CNAME record with your DNS provider which points to the `status.ingress[0].host` of the created `Route`:
----
$ kubectl get -n <namespace> route <quayregistry-name>-quay-builder -o jsonpath={.status.ingress[0].host}
----

* Using the OpenShift UI or CLI, update the `Secret` referenced by `spec.configBundleSecret` of the `QuayRegistry` with the build cluster CA certificate (name the key `extra_ca_cert_build_cluster.cert`), and update the `config.yaml` entry with the correct values referenced in the builder config above (depending on your build executor) along with following fields:
[source,yaml]
----
  BUILDMAN_HOSTNAME: <build-manager-hostname>
----

Each configuration field is explained below:

BUILDMAN_HOSTNAME:: The externally accessible server hostname which the build jobs use to communicate back to the build manager. Default is the same as `SERVER_HOSTNAME`. For OpenShift `Route`, it is either `status.ingress[0].host` or the CNAME entry if using a custom hostname.

== Troubleshooting Builds
The builder instances started by the build manager are ephemeral. This means that they will either get shut down by {productname}} on timeouts/failure or garbaged collected by the control plane (EC2/K8s). This means that in order to get the builder logs, one needs to do so **while** the builds are running.

=== DEBUG config flag
A DEBUG flag can be set in order to prevent the builder instances from getting cleaned up after completion/failure. To do so, in the desired executor configuration, set DEBUG to true. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
  EXECUTORS:
    - EXECUTOR: ec2
      DEBUG: true
      ...
    - EXECUTOR: kubernetes
      DEBUG: true
      ...
----

When set to true, DEBUG will prevent the build nodes from shutting down after the quay-builder service is done or fails, and will prevent the build manager from cleaning up the instances (terminating EC2 instances or deleting k8s jobs).
This will allow debugging builder node issues, and **should not** be set in a production environment. The lifetime service will still exist. i.e The instance will still shutdown after approximately 2 hours (EC2 instances will terminate, k8s jobs will complete)
Setting DEBUG will also affect ALLOWED_WORKER_COUNT, as the unterminated instances/jobs will still count towards the total number of running workers. This means the existing builder workers will need to manually be deleted if ALLOWED_WORKER_COUNT is reached to be able to schedule new builds.

Use the followings steps:

ifdef::upstream[]
=== EC2
. Start a build in {productname}
. In the EC2 console, identify the instance started for the build. Build instances are named “Quay Ephemeral Builder” with Tag {“BuildUUID”: <uuid>}
. Using the SSH key set by EC2_KEY_NAME, login to the builder instance with:
+
```
$ ssh -i /path/to/ssh/key/in/ec2/or/config/id_rsa core@<instance-ip>
```
+
. Get the quay-builder service logs:
+
```
$ systemctl status quay-builder
$ journalctl -f -u quay-builder
```


=== OpenShift/K8S
endif::upstream[]

. The guest VM forwards its SSH port (22) to its host’s (the pod) port 2222. Port forward the builder pod’s port 2222 to a port on localhost. e.g
+
```
$ kubectl port-forward <builder pod> 9999:2222
```
+
. SSH into the VM running inside the container using a key set from SSH_AUTHORIZED_KEYS:
+
```
$ ssh -i /path/to/ssh/key/set/in/ssh_authorized_keys -p 9999 core@localhost
```
+
. Get the quay-builder service logs:
+
```
$ systemctl status quay-builder
$ journalctl -f -u quay-builder
```
+
* Step 2-3 can also be done in a single SSH command:
+
```
$ ssh -i /path/to/ssh/key/set/in/ssh_authorized_keys -p 9999 core@localhost ‘systemctl status quay-builder’
$ ssh -i /path/to/ssh/key/set/in/ssh_authorized_keys -p 9999 core@localhost ‘journalctl -f -u quay-builder’
```
