[[build-support]]
= Automatically building Dockerfiles with build workers

{productname} supports building Dockerfiles using a set of worker nodes. Build triggers,
such as GitHub webhooks
can be configured to automatically build
new versions of your repositories when new code is committed. This document will walk
you through enabling the feature flag and setting up multiple build workers to enable
this feature.

[[enable-building-dockerfile]]
== Enabling builds

. Open the Config Tool for your {productname} cluster.

. Scroll down to the section entitled _Dockerfile Build Support_.
+
image:enable-build.png[Select Enable Dockerfile Build]

. Check the _Enable Dockerfile Build_ box. You are prompted to Enable
different types of build triggers.

. Select the type of build triggers you want to enable: 
GitHub Build Triggers, BitBucket Build Triggers, or GitLab Build Triggers.
Depending on which you enable, you are prompted to further configure those triggers:
+
* **Enable GitHub Triggers**: For the GitHub box, select GitHub Enterprise or GitHub.io.
For GitHub Endpoint, provide the http:// or https:// address for the GitHub endpoint.
For OAuth Client ID, enter the client ID for your OAuth client.
For OAuth Client Secret, enter the secret needed to access the OAuth client.
* **Enable BitBucket Triggers**: To use BitBucket triggers to start registry builds,
you need a registered BitBucket OAuth application. Then you must enter the OAuth
consumer key and OAuth consumer secret here.
* **Enable GitLab Triggers**: For GitLab, select GitLab CE/EE or GitLab.com. For GitLab
Endpoint,  provide the http:// or https:// address for the GitLab endpoint.
For Application id, provide the ID for the registered GitLab OAuth application.
For Secret, enter the secret associated with the Application id. The callback URL for
your {productname} cluster is provided.

. Click "Save Configuration Changes"

. Restart the container (you will be prompted)

[[set-up-the-build-workers]]
== Setting up build workers

image:workers.png[Set up build workers]

One or more build workers will communicate with {productname} to build new
containers when triggered. The machines must have Docker installed and must
not be used for any other work. The following procedure needs to be done every
time a new worker needs to be added, but it can be automated fairly easily.

[[pull-the-build-worker-image]]
=== Pull the build worker image

Pull down the latest copy of the image. Make sure to pull the version tagged matching your {productname} version.

ifdef::upstream[]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
====
# docker pull <registry>/<repo>/quay-builder:{productminv}
====
endif::upstream[]

ifdef::downstream[]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
====
# docker pull {productrepo}/quay-builder:{productminv}
====
endif::downstream[]

[[run-the-build-worker-image]]
=== Run the build worker image
Run this container on each build worker. Since the worker will be
orchestrating docker builds, we need to mount in the docker socket. This
orchestration will use a large amount of CPU and need to manipulate the docker
images on disk â€” we recommend that dedicated machines be used for this task.

Use the environment variable SERVER to tell the worker the hostname at which {productname} is accessible:
[cols="2a,8a",options="header"]
|===
|Security |Websocket Address

|Using SSL
|wss://your.quayenterprise.dnsname

|Without SSL
|ws://your.quayenterprise.dnsname
|===

Here's what the full command looks like:

ifdef::upstream[]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
....
# docker run --restart on-failure \
  -e SERVER=ws://myquayenterprise \
  --privileged=true \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:Z \
  <registry>/<repo>/quay-builder:{productminv}
....
endif::upstream[]

ifdef::downstream[]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
....
# docker run --restart on-failure \
  -e SERVER=ws://myquayenterprise \
  --privileged=true \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:Z \
  {productrepo}/quay-builder:{productminv}
....
endif::downstream[]

When the container starts, each build worker will auto-register and start building containers once a job is triggered and it is assigned to a worker.

If {productname} is setup to use a SSL certificate that is not globally trusted, for example a self-signed certificate, {productname}'s public SSL certificates must be mounted onto the quay-builder container's SSL trust store. An example command to mount a certificate found at the host's /path/to/ssl/rootCA.pem looks like:

[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
....
# docker run --restart on-failure \
  -e SERVER=wss://myquayenterprise \
  --privileged=true \
  -v /path/to/ssl/rootCA.pem:/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/rootCA.pem \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:Z \
  {productrepo}/quay-builder:{productminv}
....
[[set-up-github-build]]
== Setting up GitHub builds (optional)
If your organization plans to have builds be conducted via pushes to GitHub
(or GitHub Enterprise), continue with _Creating an OAuth application in GitHub_.
