[[rn-3-500]]
== Version 3.5.0

=== quay / clair / quay-builder

Note:

Some features of Quay are not currently available when running on a FIPS-enabled OCP cluster or RHEL system:

* FEATURE_MAILING will not work for user create validation, vulnerability notifications, and export logs
* Azure object storage is not available due to hashing
* Deprecated app-registry will not function

Tech Preview

* Due to necessary changes, the existing Red Hat Quay builders had to be removed and entirely rewritten. This has resulted in a loss of functionality so the new builders are being released as link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview]. Currently, builds are only available on OpenShift/Kubernetes utilizing Red Hat CoreOS for the sandbox VMs. The internal build manager has also been completely re-written to use gRPC and numerous core issues have been addressed. Please follow the provided documentation carefully when setting up.

Deprecated:

* Clair V2 (clair-jwt): With the GA of Clair V4, this version of Clair is now marked as deprecated.  Users are encouraged to migrate to Clair V4 with this release.  Clair V2 will be removed completely in the next release.
* App Registry: Customers using the App Registry feature should begin migrating to another application storage solution such as Helm V3 which uses the OCI standard container format.  App Registry will be completely removed in the next release.
