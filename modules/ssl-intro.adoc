= Using SSL/TLS

To configure {productname} with a self-signed certificate, you must create a Certificate Authority (CA) and a primary key file named `ssl.cert` and `ssl.key`.

The following examples assume that you have configured the server hostname `quay-server.example.com` using DNS or another naming mechanism, such as adding an entry in your `/etc/hosts` file. For more information, see "Configuring port mapping for {productname}".
