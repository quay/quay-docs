= Performing health checks on {productname} deployments 

Health check mechanisms are designed to assess the health and functionality of a system, service, or component. Health checks help ensure that everything is working correctly, and can be used to identify potential issues before they become critical problems. By monitoring the health of a system, {productname} administrators can address abnormalities or potential failures for things like geo-replication deployments, Operator deployments, standalone {productname} deployments, object storage issues, and so on. Performing health checks can also help reduce the likelihood of encountering troubleshooting scenarios. 

Health check mechanisms can play a role in diagnosing issues by providing valuable information about the system's current state. By comparing health check results with expected benchmarks or predefined thresholds, deviations or anomalies can be identified quicker.

{productname} has several health check endpoints. The following table shows you the health check, a description, an endpoint, and an example output. 

.Health check endpoints
[cols="1a,3a,2a,2a",options="header"]
|===
|Health check |Description |Endpoint |Example output 
|`instance` | The `instance` endpoint acquires the entire status of the specific {productname} instance. Returns a `dict` with key-value pairs for the following: `auth`, `database`, `disk_space`, `registry_gunicorn`, `service_key`, and `web_gunicorn.` Returns a number indicating the health check response of either `200`, which indicates that the instance is healthy, or `503`, which indicates an issue with your deployment. |`https://{quay-ip-endpoint}/health/instance` _or_ `https://{quay-ip-endpoint}/health` | `{"data":{"services":{"auth":true,"database":true,"disk_space":true,"registry_gunicorn":true,"service_key":true,"web_gunicorn":true}},"status_code":200}` 

|`endtoend` |The `endtoend` endpoint conducts checks on all services of your {productname} instance. Returns a `dict` with key-value pairs for the following: `auth`, `database`, `redis`, `storage`. Returns a number indicating the health check response of either `200`, which indicates that the instance is healthy, or `503`, which indicates an issue with your deployment. |`https://{quay-ip-endpoint}/health/endtoend` | `{"data":{"services":{"auth":true,"database":true,"redis":true,"storage":true}},"status_code":200}` 

|`warning` |The `warning` endpoint conducts a check on the warnings. Returns a `dict` with key-value pairs for the following: `disk_space_warning`. Returns a number indicating the health check response of either `200`, which indicates that the instance is healthy, or `503`, which indicates an issue with your deployment.
|`https://{quay-ip-endpoint}/health/warning` | `{"data":{"services":{"disk_space_warning":true}},"status_code":503}`

== Navigating to a {productname} health check endpoint

Use the following procedure to navigate to the `instance` endpoint. This procedure can be repeated for `endtoend` and `warning` endpoints.

.Procedure

. On your web browser, navigate to `https://{quay-ip-endpoint}/health/instance`.

. You are taken to the health instance page, which returns information like the following:
+
[source,json]
----
{"data":{"services":{"auth":true,"database":true,"disk_space":true,"registry_gunicorn":true,"service_key":true,"web_gunicorn":true}},"status_code":200}
----
+
For {productname}, `"status_code": 200` means that the instance is health. Conversely, if you receive `"status_code": 503`, there is an issue with your deployment.
