= Robot account tokens 

Robot account _tokens_ are  _password-type_ credentials used to access a {productname} registry via normal Docker v2 endpoints; these are defined as _tokens_ on the UI because the password itself is encrypted.

Robot account tokens are persistent tokens designed for automation and continuous integration workflows. By default, {productname}'s robot account tokens do not expire and do not require user interaction, which makes robot accounts ideal for non-interactive use cases.

Robot account tokens are automatically generated at the time of a robot's creation and are non-user specific; that is, they are connected to the user and organization namespace where where they are created. for example, a robot named `project_tools+<robot_name>` is associated with the `project_tools` namespace.

Robot account tokens provide access without needing a user's personal credentials. How the robot account is configured, for example, with one of `READ`, `WRITE`, or `ADMIN` permissions, ultimately defines the actions that the robot account can take.

Because robot account tokens are persistent and do not expire by default, they are ideal for automated workflows that require consistent access to {productname} without manual renewal. Despite this, robot account tokens can be easily re-generated by using the the UI. They can also be regenerated by using the proper API endpoint via the CLI. To enhance the security of your {productname} deployment, administrators should regularly refresh robot account tokens. Additionally, with the link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/use_red_hat_quay/index#keyless-authentication-robot-accounts[_keyless authentication with robot accounts_] feature, robot account tokens can be exchanged for external OIDC tokens and leveraged so that they only last one hour, enhancing the security of your registry.

When a namespace gets deleted, or when the robot account is deleted itself, they are garbage collected when the collector is scheduled to run.

The following section shows you how to use the API to re-generate a robot account token for organization robots and user robots.
