= Air-gapped / disconnected deployments

The image below shows the two ways that {productname} and Clair run in air-gapped, or disconnected, environments:  

* {productname} and Clair connected to the internet, with an air-gapped OpenShift cluster accessing the Quay registry through an explicit, white-listed hole in the firewall

* {productname} and Clair running inside the firewall, with image and CVE data transferred to the target system using offline media. The data is exported from a separate Quay and Clair deployment that is connected to the internet.
