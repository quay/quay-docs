In the following diagram, the upper deployment in the diagram shows {productname} and Clair connected to the internet, with an air-gapped {ocp} cluster accessing the {productname} registry through an explicit, allowlisted hole in the firewall.

The lower deployment in the diagram shows {productname} and Clair running inside of the firewall, with image and CVE data transferred to the target system using offline media. The data is exported from a separate {productname} and Clair deployment that is connected to the internet.

The following diagram shows how {productname} and Clair can be deployed in air-gapped or disconnected environments:
