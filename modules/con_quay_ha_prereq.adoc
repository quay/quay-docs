= Preparing for {productname} (high availability)

[NOTE]
====
This procedure presents guidance on how to set up a highly available, production-quality deployment of {productname}.
====

== Prerequisites

Here are a few things you need to know before you begin the {productname} high availability deployment:

* Either Postgres or MySQL can be used to provide the database service. Postgres was chosen here as the database because it includes the features needed to support Clair security scanning. Other options include:
** Crunchy Data PostgreSQL Operator: Although not supported directly by Red Hat,
the link:https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/latest/[CrunchDB Operator]
is available from link:https://www.crunchydata.com/[Crunchy Data] for use with {productname}.
If you take this route, you should have a support contract with Crunchy Data and
work directly with them for usage guidance or issues relating to the operator and their database.
** If your organization already has a high-availability (HA) database, you can use that database
with {productname}. See the
link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/rhquay/policies[{productname} Support Policy]
for details on support for third-party databases and other components.

* Ceph Object Gateway (also called RADOS Gateway) is one example of a product that
can provide the object storage needed by {productname}. If you want your
{productname} setup to do geo-replication, Ceph Object Gateway or other supported
object storage is required. For cloud installations, you can use any of the following cloud object storage:

** Amazon S3 (see link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3680151[S3 IAM Bucket Policy] for details on configuring an S3 bucket policy for Quay)
** Azure Blob Storage
** Google Cloud Storage
** Ceph Object Gateway
** OpenStack Swift
** CloudFront + S3
** NooBaa S3 Storage

* The haproxy server is used in this example, although you can use any proxy service that works for
your environment.

* Number of systems: This procedure uses seven systems (physical or virtual) that are assigned with the following tasks:

** **A: db01: Load balancer and database**: Runs the haproxy load balancer and a Postgres database. Note that these components are not themselves highly available, but are used to indicate how you might set up your own load balancer or production database.
** **B: quay01, quay02, quay03: Quay and Redis**: Three (or more) systems are assigned to run the Quay and Redis services.
** **C: ceph01, ceph02, ceph03, ceph04, ceph05: Ceph**: Three (or more) systems provide the Ceph service, for storage. If you are deploying to a cloud, you can use the cloud storage features described earlier. This procedure employs an additional system for Ansible (ceph05) and one for a Ceph Object Gateway (ceph04).

Each system should have the following attributes:

* **Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)**: Obtain the latest Red Hat Enterprise Linux server media from the link:https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/69/ver=/rhel---7/7.5/x86_64/product-software[Downloads page] and follow instructions from the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html-single/installation_guide/index[Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Installation Guide] to install RHEL on each system.
** **Valid Red Hat Subscription**: Obtain Red Hat Enterprise Linux server subscriptions and apply one to each system.
** **CPUs**: Two or more virtual CPUs
** **RAM**: 4GB for each A and B system; 8GB for each C system
** **Disk space**:  About 20GB of disk space for each A and B system (10GB for the operating system and 10GB for docker storage).  At least 30GB of disk space for C systems (or more depending on required container storage).
