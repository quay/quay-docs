= Disabling the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler

As HPA is configured by default to be `managed`, the number of pods for Quay, Clair and repository mirroring is set to two. This facilitates the avoidance of downtime when updating / reconfiguring Quay via the Operator or during rescheduling events.

If you wish to disable autoscaling or create your own `HorizontalPodAutoscaler`, simply specify the component as unmanaged in the `QuayRegistry` instance:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: quay.redhat.com/v1
kind: QuayRegistry
metadata:
  name: example-registry
  namespace: quay-enterprise
spec:
  components:
    - kind: horizontalpodautoscaler
      managed: false
