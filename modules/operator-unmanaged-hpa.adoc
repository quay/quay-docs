= Using unmanaged Horizontal Pod Autoscalers

Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPAs) are now included with the `Clair`, `Quay`, and `Mirror` pods, so that they now automatically scale during load spikes.

As HPA is configured by default to be managed, the number of `Clair`, `Quay`, and `Mirror` pods is set to two. This facilitates the avoidance of downtime when updating or reconfiguring {productname} through the Operator or during rescheduling events.

== Disabling the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler

To disable autoscaling or create your own `HorizontalPodAutoscaler`, specify the component as `unmanaged` in the `QuayRegistry` instance. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: quay.redhat.com/v1
kind: QuayRegistry
metadata:
  name: example-registry
  namespace: quay-enterprise
spec:
  components:
    - kind: horizontalpodautoscaler
      managed: false
