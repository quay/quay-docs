= Using unmanaged Horizontal Pod Autoscalers

Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPAs) are now included with the `Clair`, `Quay`, and `Mirror` pods, so that they now automatically scale during load spikes.

As HPA is configured by default to be managed, the number of `Clair`, `Quay`, and `Mirror` pods is set to two. This facilitates the avoidance of downtime when updating or reconfiguring {productname} through the Operator or during rescheduling events.

[NOTE]
====
There is a known issue when disabling the `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` component and attempting to edit the HPA resource itself and increase the value of the `minReplicas` field. When attempting this setup, `Quay` application pods are scaled out by the unmanaged HPA and, after 60 seconds, the replica count is reconciled by the {productname} Operator. As a result, HPA pods are continuously created and then removed by the Operator. 

To resolve this issue, you should upgrade your {productname} deployment to at least version 3.12.5 or 3.13.1 and then use the following example to avoid the issue.

This issue will be fixed in a future version of {productname}. For more information, see link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-6474[PROJQUAY-6474].

== Disabling the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler

To disable autoscaling or create your own `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` component, specify the component as `unmanaged` in the `QuayRegistry` custom resource definition. To avoid the known issue noted above, you must modify the `QuayRegistry` CRD object and set the replicas equal to `null` for the `quay`, `clair`, and `mirror` components. 

.Procedure

* Edit the `QuayRegistry` CRD to include the following `replicas: null` for the `quay` component:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit quayregistry <quay_registry_name> -n <quay_namespace>
----
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: quay.redhat.com/v1
kind: QuayRegistry
metadata:
name: quay-registry
namespace: quay-enterprise
spec:
components:
  - kind: horizontalpodautoscaler
    managed: false
  - kind: quay
    managed: true
    overrides: 
      replicas: null <1>
  - kind: clair
    managed: true
    overrides:
      replicas: null
  - kind: mirror
    managed: true
    overrides:
      replicas: null
# ...
----
<1> After setting `replicas: null` in your `QuayRegistry` CRD, a new replica set might be generated because the deployment manifest of the `Quay` app is changed with `replicas: 1`. 

.Verification

. Create a customized `HorizontalPodAutoscalers` CRD and increase the `minReplicas` amount to a higher value, for exampe, `3`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
metadata:
  name: quay-registry-quay-app
  namespace: quay-enterprise
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    kind: Deployment
    name: quay-registry-quay-app
    apiVersion: apps/v1
  minReplicas: 3
  maxReplicas: 20
  metrics:
    - type: Resource
      resource:
        name: memory
        target:
          type: Utilization
          averageUtilization: 90
    - type: Resource
      resource:
        name: cpu
        target:
          type: Utilization
          averageUtilization: 90

. Ensure that your `QuayRegistry` application successfully starts by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pod | grep quay-app
