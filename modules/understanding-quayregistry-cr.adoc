= Understanding the QuayRegistry CR

The `QuayRegistry` custom resource (CR) is the interface for defining the desired state of your Quay deployment. This resource focuses on managing the core components of the registry, such as the database, cache, and stroage.

The `QuayRegistry` CR is used to determine whether a component is _managed_, or automatically handled by the Operator, or _unmanaged_, or provided externally by the user. 

By default, the `QuayRegistry` CR contains the following key fields:

* `configBundleSecret`: The name of a Kubernetes Secret containing the `config.yaml` file which defines additional configuration parameters.
* `name`: The name of your {productname} registry.
* `namespace`: The namespace, or project, in which the registry was created.
* `spec.components`: A list of component that the Operator automatically manages. Each `spec.component` field contains two fields:
** `kind`: The name of the component
** `managed`: A boolean that addresses whether the component lifecycle is handled by the {productname} Operator. Setting `managed: true` to a component in the `QuayRegistry` CR means that the Operator manages the component.

All `QuayRegistry` components are automatically managed and auto-filled upon reconciliation for visibility unless specified otherwise. The following sections highlight the major `QuayRegistry` components and provide an example YAML file that shows the default settings.
