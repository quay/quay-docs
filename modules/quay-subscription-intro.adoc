= {productname} subscription information 

{productname} is available with Standard or Premium support, and subscriptions are based on deployments. 

[NOTE]
====
Deployment means an installation of a single {productname} registry using a shared data backend.

With a {productname} subscription the following can be considered irrelevant: 

* How big the deployment is, for example, there is no limit on the number of pods (Quay, Clair, Builder, etc.) a user can create
* In how many data centers/availability zones Quay pods can run 
* How many storage backends or database backends are running, as long as it is one shared database and one shared storage backend 
* Whether {productname} is managing content for a single cluster or thousands of clusters 
* Whether a user is physically located near the same cluster or datacenter
* Whether the target destination is an OpenShift cluster or any other OCI compliant client
* Additional costs for CSO and the Quay Bridge Operator 

[NOTE]
====
{productname} geo-replication requires a subscription for each storage replication. The database, however, is shared.
