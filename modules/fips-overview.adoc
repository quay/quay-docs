= Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) readiness and compliance

[role="_abstract"]
The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is regarded as the highly regarded for securing and encrypting sensitive data, notably in highly regulated areas such as banking, healthcare, and the public sector. {rhel} and {ocp} support FIPS by providing a _FIPS mode_, in which the system only allows usage of specific FIPS-validated cryptographic modules like `openssl`. This ensures FIPS compliance.
