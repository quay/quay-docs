= FIPS readiness and compliance 

FIPS (the Federal Information Processing Standard developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST) is regarded as the gold standard for securing and encrypting sensitive data, particularly in heavily regulated areas such as banking, healthcare and the public sector. Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform support this standard by providing a FIPS mode in which the system would only allow usage of certain, FIPS-validated cryptographic modules, like `openssl`. This ensures FIPS compliance.

{productname} supports running on FIPS-enabled RHEL and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform from version 3.5.
