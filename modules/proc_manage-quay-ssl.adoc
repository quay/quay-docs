[[using-ssl-to-protect-quay]]
= Using SSL to protect connections to {productname}

This document assumes you have deployed {productname} in a link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/getting_started_with_red_hat_quay/[single-node] or link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/deploy_red_hat_quay_-_high_availability[highly available] deployment.

To configure {productname} with a
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-signed_certificate[self-signed
certificate], you need to create a Certificate Authority (CA), then generate the required key and certificate files. You then enter those files using the {productname} Config Tool or command line.

[[create-a-ca-and-sign-a-certificate]]
== Create a CA and sign a certificate

. Create a root CA.
+
```
$ openssl genrsa -out rootCA.key 2048
$ openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key rootCA.key -sha256 -days 1024 -out rootCA.pem
```
+
The result are rootCA.key and rootCA.pem files in the current directory.

. **Create certificate and private key**:
If you are having {productname} handle TLS, you need to create a certificate
and private key to provide during configuration. You can get those files
from a certificate signing authority. Here we show how to create those
files using the self-signed certificate authority you just created.
+
In this example, you create device.crt and device.key files, which
will be uploaded to {productname} and renamed ssl.cert and ssl.key, respectively.
+
Because OpenShift creates long fully qualified domain names, consider using a wildcard to
identify the larger domain, instead of the specific route to the {productname} application.
For example, use something like *.apps.openshift.example.com when prompted for the server's hostname:
+
```
Common Name (eg, your name or your server's hostname) []:*apps.openshift.example.com
```

+
```
$ openssl genrsa -out device.key 2048
$ openssl req -new -key device.key -out device.csr
```
+
Then sign the certificate with the root CA created earlier:
+
```
$ openssl x509 -req -in device.csr -CA rootCA.pem \
       -CAkey rootCA.key -CAcreateserial -out device.crt -days 500 -sha256
```

[NOTE]
====
Instead generating the *.key and *.crt files as just shown,
you could create an `openssl.cnf` file. This lets you add more information
to the resulting certificate than you can get by just responding to the prompts
in the command for generating the certificate request. In this example of an
`openssl.cnf` file, replace `DNS.1` and `IP.1` with the hostname and IP
address of the {productname} server:

`openssl.cnf`

```
[req]
req_extensions = v3_req
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
[req_distinguished_name]
[ v3_req ]
basicConstraints = CA:FALSE
keyUsage = nonRepudiation, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment
subjectAltName = @alt_names
[alt_names]
DNS.1 = reg.example.com
IP.1 = 12.345.678.9
```
You could then generate the key as follows:
```
$ openssl x509 -req -in ssl.csr -CA rootCA.pem \
   -CAkey rootCA.key -CAcreateserial -out ssl.cert \
   -days 356 -extensions v3_req -extfile openssl.cnf
```

[[configuring-quay-to-use-the-new-certificate]]
== Configure {productname} to use the new certificate

The next step can be accomplished either in the {productname} screen or from the terminal.

[[configure-with-superuser-gui-in-quay]]
=== Configure SSL from the {productname} Setup screen
Start the quay container in config mode, as described
in each deployment guide. In the server
Configuration section, enable SSL as follows:

. Set the `Server Hostname` to the appropriate value and check the
`Enable SSL` box, then upload the `ssl.key` and `ssl.cert` files
(in our example, named `device.key` and `device.crt`, respectively):
image:server-config.png[Enable SSL]
. Save the configuration. {productname} will automatically validate the SSL
certificate:
image:save-configuration.png[validating SSL]
. Restart the container
image:restart-container.png[restart the container]

[[to-configure-with-the-command-line]]
=== Configure with the command line

By not using the web interface the configuration checking mechanism
built into {productname} is unavailable. It is suggested to use the web interface
if possible. For non-OpenShift installations, you
can configure SSL from the command-line interface
as follows:

. Copy the `ssl.key` and `ssl.cert` into the specified `config` directory.
In this example, the config directory for {productname} is on a host named reg.example.com in a directory
named /mnt/quay/config.
+
[NOTE]
====
The certificate/key files must be named ssl.key and ssl.cert.
====
+
```
$ ls
ssl.cert  ssl.key
$ scp ssl.* root@reg.example.com:/mnt/quay/config/
[root@reg.example.com ~]$ ls /mnt/quay/config/
config.yaml  ssl.cert  ssl.key
```

. Modify the `PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME:` parameter in config.yaml from `http`
to `https`
+
```
PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME: https
```

. Restart the {productname} container:
+
```
$ sudo podman ps
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                     COMMAND                 CREATED       STATUS      PORTS                   NAMES

$ sudo podman restart cbe7b0fa39d8
```

[[test-the-secure-connection]]
=== Test the secure connection


Confirm the configuration by visiting the URL from a browser
`https://reg.example.com/`
image:https-browser.png[restart the container]
"Your Connection is not secure" means the CA is untrusted but confirms
that SSL is functioning properly.
To avoid these messages, you need to get a certificate from a trusted certificate authority.

[[configuring-docker-to-trust-a-certificate-authority]]
== Configuring Docker to Trust a Certificate Authority

Docker requires that custom certs be installed to `/etc/docker/certs.d/`
under a directory with the same name as the hostname private registry.
It is also required for the cert to be called `ca.crt`. Here is how to do that:

. Copy the rootCA file.
+
```
$ cp tmp/rootCA.pem /etc/docker/certs.d/reg.example.com/ca.crt
```
. After you have copied the rootCA.pem file, `docker login` should authenticate
successfully and pushing to the repository should succeed.
+
```
$ sudo docker push reg.example.com/kbrwn/hello
The push refers to a repository [reg.example.com/kbrwn/hello]
