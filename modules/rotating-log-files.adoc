= Rotating log files of {productname} containers

In some cases, users have found that the log rotation configurations for Nginx within the {productname} image do not function as intended. This leads to the logs not being rotated properly. 

{productname} containers do not have a `logrotate` binary. Nginx logs are forwarded to `/dev/stdout` by default. The log rotation for these logs is governed by the container runtime that you are using.

To address the log rotation for {productname} container logs, you must configure log rotation at the container runtime level. Refer to the documentation or configuration options of your container runtime to set up log rotation for {ProductName} container logs accordingly.
