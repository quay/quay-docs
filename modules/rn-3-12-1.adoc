== {productname} 3.12.1 bug fixes

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-7177[PROJQUAY-7177]. Previously, global read-only superusers could not obtain resources from an organization when using the API. This issue has been resolved.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-7446[PROJQUAY-7446]. Previously, global read-only superusers could not obtain correct information when using the `listRepos` API endpoints. This issue has been resolved.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-7449[PROJQUAY-7449]. Previously, global read-only superusers could not use some `superuser` API endpoints. This issue has been resolved.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-7487[PROJQUAY-7487]. Previously, when a repository had multiple notifications enabled, the wrong type of event notification could be triggered. This issue has been resolved.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-7491[PROJQUAY-7491]. When using NetAPP's OnTAP S3 implementation, the follow errors could be returned: `presigned URL request computed using signature-version v2 is not supported by ONTAP-S3`. This error occurred because `boto` iterates over a map of authentications if none is requested, and returns `v2` because it is ordered earlier than `v4`. This issue has been fixed, and the error is no longer returned.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-7578[PROJQUAY-7578]. On the 3.12.1 UI, the release notes pointed to {productname}'s 3.7 release. This has been fixed, and they now point to the current version.
