Tokens can be obtained through various means, such as OAuth or by generating API tokens within the {productname} user interface. Token-based authentication is often used for automated or programmatic access to the registry.

* *External identity provider*. {productname} can integrate with external identity providers, such as LDAP or AzureAD, for authentication purposes. This integration allows organizations to use their existing identity management infrastructure, enabling centralized user authentication and reducing the need for separate user databases.
