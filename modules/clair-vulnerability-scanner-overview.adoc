Clair v4 (Clair) is an open source application that leverages static code analyses for parsing image content and reporting vulnerabilities affecting the content. Clair is packaged with {quayio}, is automatically enabled, and is managed by the {productname} development team. 

For {quayio} users, images are automatically indexed after they are pushed to your repository. Reports are then fetched from Clair, which matches images against its CVE's database to report security information. This process happens automatically on {quayio}, and manual recans are not required.
