[id="oidc-team-sync-known-issues"]
== {productname} OIDC team synchronization known issues

* There is a known issue when {productname} uses OIDC as the authentication type with Microsoft Entra ID (previously Azure Active Directory).
+
After logging in to {productname}, users are unable to set a password via the *User Settings* page. This is necessary for authentication when using Docker/Podman CLI to perform image push or pull operations to the registry.
+
As a workaround, you can use Docker CLI and App Token as credentials when authenticating via OIDC. These tokens, alongside robot tokens, serve as an alternative to passwords and are considered the prescribed method for providing access to {productname} when authenticating via OIDC.
+
For more information, see link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-6754[*PROJQUAY-6754*].

* Currently, when an OIDC user is removed from their OIDC provider, the user is not removed from the team on {productname}. They are still able to use the robot account token and app token to push and pull images from the registry. This is the expected behavior, however this behavior will be changed in a future version of {productname}. 
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-6842[*PROJQUAY-6842*])

* When using Microsoft Entra ID as your OIDC provider, {productname} administrators must input the *Object ID* of the OIDC group instead of the group name. The v2 UI does not currently alert users that Microsoft Entra ID users must input the Object ID of the OIDC group. This is a known issue and will be fixed in a future version of {productname}. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-6917[*PROJQUAY-6917*])

* When using Amazon Web Services (AWS) Security Token Service (STS) with proxy storage enabled, users are unable to pull images and the following error is returned: `Error: copying system image from manifest list: parsing image configuration: fetching blob: received unexpected HTTP status: 502 Bad Gateway`. This is a known issue and will be fixed in a future version of {productname}.

* Upgrading {productname-ocp} from 3.8 to 3.11 does not work. Users must upgrade from {productname-ocp} from 3.8 to 3.9 or 3.10, and then proceed with the upgrade to 3.11. 
+
For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/upgrade_red_hat_quay/index#upgrade_overview[Upgrade {productname}].

* Attempting to set resource limitations for the `Quay` pod too low results in the pod being unable to boot up with the following statuses returned: `OOMKILLED` and `CrashLoopBackOff`. Resource limitations can not be set lower than the minimum requirement, which can be found on the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/deploying_the_red_hat_quay_operator_on_openshift_container_platform/index#configuring-resources-managed-components[Configuring resources for managed components on {ocp}] page.
