[id="new-features-and-enhancements-311"]
== {productname} new features and enhancements

The following updates have been made to {productname}.

[id="aws-sts-support-quay-311"]
=== Support for AWS STS on {productname}

Support for Amazon Web Services (AWS) Security Token Service (STS) is now offered for {productname}. AWS STS is a web service for requesting temporary, limited-privilege credentials for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users and for users that you authenticate, or _federated users_. This feature is useful for clusters using Amazon S3 as an object storage, allowing {productname} to use STS protocols to authenticate with Amazon S3, which can enhance the overall security of the cluster and help to ensure that access to sensitive data is properly authenticated and authorized. This feature is also available for {ocp} deployments.

For more information about configuring AWS STS for standalone {productname} deployments, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/manage_red_hat_quay/index#configuring-aws-sts-quay[Configuring AWS STS for {productname}]

[id="auto-pruning-enhancements"]
=== {productname} auto-pruning enhancements

With the release of {productname} 3.10, a new auto-pruning feature was released. With that feature, {productname} administrators could set up auto-pruning policies on namespaces for both users and organizations.

With this release, auto-pruning policies can now be set up on specified repositories. This feature allows for image tags to be automatically deleted within a repository based on specified criteria. Additionally, {productname} administrators can set auto-pruning policies on repositories that they have `admin` privileges for.

For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/manage_red_hat_quay/index#red-hat-quay-namespace-auto-pruning-overview[{productname} auto-pruning overview].

[id="v2-ui-enhancements-311"]
=== {productname} v2 UI enhancements 

In {productname} 3.8, a new UI was introduced as a technology preview feature. With {productname} 3.11, the following enhancements have been made to the v2 UI.

[id="usage-logs-ui-v2"]
==== {productname} v2 UI usage logs

{productname} 3.11 adds functionality for usage logs when using the v2 UI. Usage logs provide the following information about your {productname} deployment:

* *Monitoring of team activities*. Allows administrators to view team activities, such as team creation, membership changes, and role assignments. 
* *Auditing of tag history actions*. Allows security auditors to audit tag history actions, including tag creations, updates, and deletions. 
* *Tracking of repository label changes*. Allows repository owners to track changes to labels, including additions, modifications, and removals. 
* *Monitoring of expiration settings*. Allows engineers to monitor actions related to tag expiration settings, such as setting expiration dates or disabling expiration for specific tags.

Logs can be exported to an email address or to a callback URL, and are available at the Organization, repository, and namespace levels.

For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/use_red_hat_quay/index#viewing-usage-logs-v2-ui[Viewing usage logs on the {productname} v2 UI].

[id="dark-mode-ui-v2"]
==== {productname} v2 UI dark mode

{productname} 3.11 offers users the ability to switch between light and dark modes when using the v2 UI. This feature also includes an automatic mode selection, which chooses between light or dark modes depending on the user's browser preference.

For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/use_red_hat_quay/index#selecting-dark-mode-ui[Selecting color theme preference on the {productname} v2 UI].

[id="builds-support-v2-ui"]
==== Builds support on {productname} v2 UI

{productname} Builds are now supported when using the v2 UI. This feature must be enabled prior to building container images by setting `FEATURE_BUILD_SUPPORT: true` in your `config.yaml` file. 

For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/use_red_hat_quay/index#starting-a-build[Creating a new build].

[id="auto-pruning-repositories-ui"]
==== Auto-pruning repositories v2 UI

{productname} 3.11 offers users the ability to create auto-pruning policies using the v2 UI.

For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/manage_red_hat_quay/index#red-hat-quay-namespace-auto-pruning-overview[{productname} auto-pruning overview].

[id="team-synchronization-oidc"]
=== Team synchronization support via {productname} OIDC

This release allows administrators to leverage an OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider to synchronization team, or group, settings, so long as their OIDC provider supports the retrieval of group information from ID token or the `/userinfo` endpoint. Administrators can easily apply repository permissions to sets of users without having to manually create and sync group definitions between {productname} and the OIDC group, which is not scalable.

For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/manage_red_hat_quay/index#oidc-team-sync[Team synchronization for {productname} OIDC deployments]

[id="quay-operator-updates-311"]
== {productname} Operator updates

The following updates have been made to the {productname} Operator:

[id="configurable-resources-managed-components"]
=== Configurable resource requests for {productname-ocp} managed components

With this release, users can manually adjust the resource requests on {productname-ocp} for the following components that have pods running:

* `quay`
* `clair`
* `mirroring`
* `clairpostgres` 
* `postgres`

This feature allows users to run smaller test clusters, or to request more resources upfront in order to avoid partially degraded `Quay` pods. 

For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/deploying_the_red_hat_quay_operator_on_openshift_container_platform/index#configuring-resources-managed-components[Configuring resources for managed components on {ocp}]

[id="aws-sts-support-quay-operator-311"]
=== Support for AWS STS on {productname-ocp}

Support for Amazon Web Services (AWS) Security Token Service (STS) is now offered for {productname} deployments on {ocp}. AWS STS is a web service for requesting temporary, limited-privilege credentials for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users and for users that you authenticate, or _federated users_. This feature is useful for clusters using Amazon S3 as an object storage, allowing {productname} to use STS protocols to authenticate with Amazon S3, which can enhance the overall security of the cluster and help to ensure that access to sensitive data is properly authenticated and authorized. 

For more information about AWS STS for {productname-ocp}, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/red_hat_quay_operator_features/index#configuring-aws-sts-quay[Configuring AWS STS for {productname-ocp}]

* *.sts_role_arn*. The unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) required when configuring AWS STS for {productname}.
* *.sts_user_access_key*. The generated AWS S3 user access key required when configuring AWS STS for {productname}. 
* *.sts_user_secret_key*. The generated AWS S3 user secret key required when configuring AWS STS for {productname}.

For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/configure_red_hat_quay/index#config-fields-storage-aws-sts[AWS STS S3 storage].

[id="team-sync-configuration-field"]
=== Team synchronization configuration field

The following configuration field has been added for the team synchronization via OIDC feature:

* *PREFERRED_GROUP_CLAIM_NAME*: The key name within the OIDC token payload that holds information about the user's group memberships.

[id="new-api-endpoints-311"]
== New API endpoints

The following API endpoints have been added to {productname} {producty}:

[id="repository-auto-pruning-policy-endpoint"]
=== Repository auto-pruning policy endpoints: 

The repository auto-pruning policy feature introduces the following API endpoint:

* `*/api/v1/repository/<organization_or_user_name>/<repository_name>/autoprunepolicy/`
+
This API endpoint can be used with `POST`, `GET`, and `DELETE` calls to create, see, and delete auto-pruning policies on a repository for specific users in your organization. Note that you must have `admin` privileges on the repository that you are creating the policy for when using these commands.

[id="known-issues-and-limitations-310"]
== {productname} 3.11 known issues and limitations

The following sections note known issues and limitations for {productname} {producty}.

[id="oidc-team-sync-known-issues"]
=== {productname} OIDC team synchronization known issues

[id="unable-set-password-user-settings-page"]
==== Unable to set user passwords via the *User Settings* page

There is a known issue when {productname} uses OIDC as the authentication type with Microsoft Entra ID (previously Azure Active Directory).

After logging in to {productname}, users are unable to set a password via the *User Settings* page. This is necessary for authentication when using Docker/Podman CLI to perform image push or pull operations to the registry.

As a workaround, you can use Docker CLI and App Token as credentials when authenticating via OIDC. These tokens, alongside robot tokens, serve as an alternative to passwords and are considered the prescribed method for providing access to {productname} when authenticating via OIDC.

For more information, see link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-6754[*PROJQUAY-6754*].

[id="team-sync-removal-known-issue"]
==== Unable to sync change when OIDC user is removed from OIDC

Currently, when an OIDC user is removed from their OIDC provider, the user is not removed from the team on {productname}. They are still able to use the robot account token and app token to push and pull images from the registry. This is the expected behavior, however this behavior will be changed in a future version of {productname}. 
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-6842[*PROJQUAY-6842*])

[id="entra-id-team-sync-known-issue"]
==== Object ID must be used when OIDC provider is Microsoft Entra ID

When using Microsoft Entra ID as your OIDC provider, {productname} administrators must input the *Object ID* of the OIDC group instead of the group name. The v2 UI does not currently alert users that Microsoft Entra ID users must input the Object ID of the OIDC group. This is a known issue and will be fixed in a future version of {productname}. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-6917[*PROJQUAY-6917*])

[id="sts-s3-storage-known-issue"]
=== STS S3 storage known issue

When using Amazon Web Services (AWS) Security Token Service (STS) with proxy storage enabled, users are unable to pull images and the following error is returned: `Error: copying system image from manifest list: parsing image configuration: fetching blob: received unexpected HTTP status: 502 Bad Gateway`. This is a known issue and will be fixed in a future version of {productname}.

[id="upgrading-38-311-limitation"]
=== Upgrading {productname-ocp} 3.8 directly to 3.11 limitation

Upgrading {productname-ocp} from 3.8 to 3.11 does not work. Users must upgrade from {productname-ocp} from 3.8 to 3.9 or 3.10, and then proceed with the upgrade to 3.11. 

For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/upgrade_red_hat_quay/index#upgrade_overview[Upgrade {productname}].

[id="configurable-resource-limitation"]
=== Configurable resource request limitation

Attempting to set resource limitations for the `Quay` pod too low results in the pod being unable to boot up with the following statuses returned: `OOMKILLED` and `CrashLoopBackOff`. Resource limitations can not be set lower than the minimum requirement, which can be found on the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/{producty}/html-single/deploying_the_red_hat_quay_operator_on_openshift_container_platform/index#configuring-resources-managed-components[Configuring resources for managed components on {ocp}] page.

[id="dark-mode-ui-v2-known-issues"]
==== {productname} v2 UI dark mode known issue

If you are using the the automatic mode selection, which chooses between light or dark modes depending on the user's browser preference, your operating system appearance is overridden by the browser website appearance setting. If you find that the device-based theme is not working as expect, check your browser appearance setting. This is a known issue and will be fixed in a future version of {productname}. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PROJQUAY-6903[*PROJQUAY-6903*])

////

[id="tag-expiration-known-issue"]
=== Tag expiration behavior

The following behavior was observed when setting expiration time on a tag that is *older* than two years. This is not a known issue, but is instead the default behavior. This will be changed in a future version of {productname} due to the potential issues that could arise for some users.

When setting expiration time on a tag that is *older* than two years, the tag is expired immediately and subsequently garbage collected. It does not end up in the time machine, and is deleted from the registry. This issue occurs because, by default, the `LABELED_EXPIRATION_MAXIMUM` parameter is set to `104w`, or two years.

As a temporary workaround, you can increase the default value of the `LABELED_EXPIRATION_MAXIMUM` parameter in your `config.yaml` file. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
# ...
LABELED_EXPIRATION_MAXIMUM: 156w
# ...
----

By increasing the value of this field to, for example, `156w` (three years), it is possible to set the expiration time for a tag that is up to 3 years old. For example, if a tag is created on March 25, 2021, the expiration date of the tag can be set up to March 24, 2024. The expiration date of the tag could not be set to later than this date, for example, July 2024, because it is over three years from when the tag was first created. 


Additionally, {productname} administrators can add robot accounts to allowlists when disallowing the creation of new robot accounts. This ensures operability of approved robot accounts.

* Robot accounts are mandatory for repository mirroring. Setting the `ROBOTS_DISALLOW` configuration field to `true` without allowlisting supplementary robot accounts will break mirroring configurations. This will be fixed in a future version of {productname}

You must allowlist robot accounts with the `ROBOTS_WHITELIST` variable when managing robot accounts with the `ROBOTS_DISALLOW` field. Use the following reference when managing robot accounts:
+
[source,yaml]
----
ROBOTS_DISALLOW: true
ROBOTS_WHITELIST: 
  - quayadmin+robot1
  - quayadmin+robot2
  - quayadmin+robot3
----
+
