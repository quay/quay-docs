[id="dark-mode-ui-v2"]
==== {productname} v2 UI dark mode

For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html-single/use_red_hat_quay/index#selecting-dark-mode-ui[Selecting color theme preference on the {productname} v2 UI].

[id="builds-support-v2-ui"]

{productname} Builds are now supported when using the v2 UI. This feature must be enabled prior to building container images by setting `FEATURE_BUILD_SUPPORT: true` in your `config.yaml` file. 

For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html-single/use_red_hat_quay/index#building-dockerfiles[Building container images].

[id="new-quay-config-fields-311"]

[id="quay-operator-updates-311"]
== {productname} Operator

The following updates have been made to the {productname} Operator:

[id="configurable-resources-managed-components"]
=== Configurtable resource requests for {productname-ocp} managed components

With this release, users can manually adjust the resource requests on {productname-ocp} for the following components that have pods running:

* `quay`
* `clair`
* `mirroring`
* `clairpostgres` 
* `postgres`

This feature allows users to run smaller test clusters, or to request more resources upfront in order to avoid partially degraded `Quay` pods. 

For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html-single/deploying_the_red_hat_quay_operator_on_openshift_container_platform/index#configuring-resources-managed-components[Configuring resources for managed components on {ocp}]

== {productname} 3.11 known issues and limitations

The following sections note known issues and limitations for {productname} {producty}.

[id="known-issues-311"]
=== {productname} 3.11


[id="limitations-311"]
=== {productname} 3.11 limitations

////

Additionally, {productname} administrators can add robot accounts to allowlists when disallowing the creation of new robot accounts. This ensures operability of approved robot accounts.

* Robot accounts are mandatory for repository mirroring. Setting the `ROBOTS_DISALLOW` configuration field to `true` without allowlisting supplementary robot accounts will break mirroring configurations. This will be fixed in a future version of {productname}

You must allowlist robot accounts with the `ROBOTS_WHITELIST` variable when managing robot accounts with the `ROBOTS_DISALLOW` field. Use the following reference when managing robot accounts:
+
[source,yaml]
----
ROBOTS_DISALLOW: true
ROBOTS_WHITELIST: 
  - quayadmin+robot1
  - quayadmin+robot2
  - quayadmin+robot3
----
+
