////

Additionally, {productname} administrators can add robot accounts to allowlists when disallowing the creation of new robot accounts. This ensures operability of approved robot accounts.

* Robot accounts are mandatory for repository mirroring. Setting the `ROBOTS_DISALLOW` configuration field to `true` without allowlisting supplementary robot accounts will break mirroring configurations. This will be fixed in a future version of {productname}

You must allowlist robot accounts with the `ROBOTS_WHITELIST` variable when managing robot accounts with the `ROBOTS_DISALLOW` field. Use the following reference when managing robot accounts:
+
[source,yaml]
----
ROBOTS_DISALLOW: true
ROBOTS_WHITELIST: 
  - quayadmin+robot1
  - quayadmin+robot2
  - quayadmin+robot3
----
+
