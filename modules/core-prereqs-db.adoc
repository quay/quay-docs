= Database backend

The following information provides an overview of the {productname} database backend: 

* {productname} stores most of its configuration and all metadata and logs inside its database backend, however PostgreSQL is the preferred database backend because it can be used for both {productname} and Clair. {productname} also works with MySQL 5.7+, however Clair requires PostgreSQL. 

[NOTE]
==== 
* {productname} high availaibility (HA) requires an HA database setup. 
====

* Logs can be pushed into ElasticSearch. 

* {productname} typically runs off-cluster, but if the database runs on k8s or Openshift, we recommend using an Operator such as the Crunchy Data PostgreSQL Operator. 

* If {productname} is running on public cloud infrastructure, we recommend the use of the PostgreSQL services provided by your cloud provider.

* Geo-replication requires a single, shared database that is accessible from all regions.
