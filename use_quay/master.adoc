= Use {productname}

{productname} container image registries let you store container images in a
central location. As a regular user of a {productname} registry, you can
create repositories to organize your images and selectively add read (pull)
and write (push) access to the repositories you control. A user with
administrative privileges can perform a broader set of tasks, such as the
ability to add users and control default settings.

This guide assumes you have a {productname} deployed and are ready to start
setting it up and using it.
