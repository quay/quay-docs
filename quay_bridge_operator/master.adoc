[role="_abstract"]
To replace the integrated container registry in {ocp} with a {productname} registry, you can use the {qbo}. The {qbo} duplicates registry features and synchronizes namespaces, image streams, and robot accounts between your clusters.

The features enabled with the {qbo} include:

* Synchronizing {ocp} namespaces as {productname} organizations.
* Creating robot accounts for each default namespace service account.
* Creating secrets for each created robot account, and associating each robot secret to a service account as `Mountable` and `Image Pull Secret`.
* Synchronizing {ocp} image streams as {productname} repositories.
* Automatically rewriting new builds making use of image streams to output to {productname}.
* Automatically importing an image stream tag after a build completes.

By using the following procedures, you can enable bi-directional communication between your {productname} and {ocp} clusters.
