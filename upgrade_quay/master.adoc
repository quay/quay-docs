This guide describes how to upgrade to {productname} v3.2.
To upgrade from {productname} v2.y.z to {productminv}, you must:

* Upgrade from {productname} v2.y.z to v3.0.z
* Then upgrade from {productname} v3.0.z to {productminv} sequentially via each minor {productname} release

To upgrade from v3.0.z to {productminv} you must shut down your {productname} cluster,
make a small change to the configuration, then
upgrade your {productname} v3.0.z containers sequentially to each minor {productname} version (e.g. 3.1.0, 3.2.0, etc..) until reaching the latest {productminv} containers.
Procedures for these upgrades are described below.

== {productname} v2.y.z to v3.0.z upgrade
For the v2.y.z to v3.0.z part of the upgrade, you can either do
the whole upgrade with {productname} down (Synchronous) or only bring down
{productname} for a few minutes and have bulk of the upgrade continue with
{productname} running (Background).

In a background upgrade, it could take much longer
to run the upgrade (depending on how many tags need to be processed),
but it takes less total downtime. The downside of a background upgrade is
that you won't have access to the latest features until the upgrade completes
(the cluster runs from the quay v3 container
in v2 compatibility mode until the upgrade is done).

See the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html-single/red_hat_quay_release_notes/index[Red Hat Quay Release Notes] for information on v3 features.

== {productname} v3.y.z to {productminv} upgrade

{productname} supports upgrades from a prior (N-1) minor version only.  For example, upgrading from 3.0.1 to 3.2.1 is not supported.  You will need to first upgrade from 3.0.1 to 3.1.0 before attempting to upgrade to 3.2.1.  This is required to ensure that any necessary database migrations are done correctly and in the right order during the upgrade.

Once your {productname} cluster is running on the correct N-1 minor version and your V3_UPGRADE_MODE
is completed, you can upgrade that cluster to {productminv} by:

* Taking all hosts in the {productname} cluster out of service

* Making a small change to the configuration (as described later)

* Use the new configuration file to fully migrate to a new {productminv} container

* Checking that the new {productminv} container is performing well

* Add the {productminv} hosts back into service.
