= Upgrade {productname}

== Upgrade overview

The upgrade procedure for {productname} depends on the type of installation you are using. 

The {productname} Operator provides a simple method to deploy and manage a {productname} cluster. This is the preferred procedure for deploying {productname} on OpenShift. 
The Quay Operator should be upgraded using the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/operators/understanding/olm/olm-understanding-olm.html[Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)] as described in the section "Upgrading Quay using the Quay Operator".

The procedure for upgrading a proof-of-concept or highly available installation of {productname} and Clair is documented in the section "Standalone upgrade".

[IMPORTANT]
====
{productname} only supports rolling back, or downgrading, to previous z-stream versions, for example, 3.7.2 -> 3.7.1.  Rolling back to previous y-stream versions (3.7.0 -> 3.6.0) is not supported. This is because {productname} updates might contain database schema upgrades that are applied when upgrading to a new version of {productname}. Database schema upgrades are not considered backwards compatible.
